"Firstly, Rose is a better person than me because I'd have done what that man told her and spent the rest of my days in prison, in peace. 7/10, this is the rating I'd give if I hadn't watched a lot of horrors so that's what I'm sticking with, it reminds me so much of The Ring and has a lot of the orthodox methods other horror movies used to incite fear. So nothing groundbreaking, still, for the most part they are stilly effective. Only problem is you can figure out how it's probably gonna end. I went into this pretty dozy but the first scare woke me straight up. There's a lot of jump scares and they have the desired affect then they start to get repetitive, which doesn't bode well for the end of the movie because it feels amazing at first then quickly starts to feel unimaginative as the movie keeps depending on the same old tricks. Unfortunately horror movies need to peak towards or at the end so that they leave you with a lasting impression to make you afraid to sleep in the dark. It however still is the best horror I've seen so far this year by quite some margin. I also really loved the title sequence at the beginning of the movie as well. The 'sanatorium + demon possession' horror formula is always a welcome for me.Funny thing about horrors is how tough people try to act afterwards, I sat close to this couple that were squirming at literally every jumpscare, then at the end of the movie both went ""it's probably like a 4/10"" ""yeah, horror movies just aren't scary anymore"" and that really just made my day lmfao.",firstly rose better person done man told spent rest day prison peace rating give watched lot horror sticking reminds much ring lot orthodox method horror movie used incite fear nothing groundbreaking still part stilly effective problem figure probably gonna end went pretty dozy first scare woke straight lot jump scare desired affect start get repetitive bode well end movie feel amazing first quickly start feel unimaginative movie keep depending old trick unfortunately horror movie need peak towards end leave lasting impression make afraid sleep dark however still best horror seen far year quite margin also really loved title sequence beginning movie well sanatorium demon possession horror formula always welcome funny thing horror tough people try act afterwards sat close couple squirming literally every jumpscare end movie went probably like yeah horror movie scary anymore really made day lmfao
"It's hard to shake the uneasy feeling of this film. It's grim and foggy but at the core is the idea that when trauma is passed from person to person it will consume you. With that in hand, director Parker Finn plays on the idea that most people who suffer through awful events in life will have their past consume them if they don't confront them. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a clinical psychologist who surrounds herself with the mentally broken people of New Jersey (add your own joke here). You can basically connect the dots as to how she became good at her job. One fateful day a girl comes into her office and gruesomely ends her own life. That launches Sosie's journey into her own madness. Slowly seeing things in her life. Or being haunted by voices of her past. Whatever it is knows her greatest pains. And exploits it. The mystery isn't completely satisfying to solve, but the constant moments of jerky jumpscares definitely make you feel on edge.What I particularly like is the uneasy camera work. It isn't afraid to linger long within the frame. Nor add dutch angles. It plays like 70's cinema. The frames make you squirm. Though much of the scares are telegraphed. This isn't a slasher gory flick. It's really a psychological mind bender. As mentioned before, the resolution won't make you happy. But then, it really is watching someone work through their own mental illness. If that is interesting to you, this is the movie for you.",hard shake uneasy feeling film grim foggy core idea trauma passed person person consume hand director parker finn play idea people suffer awful event life past consume confront dr rose cotter sosie bacon clinical psychologist surround mentally broken people new jersey add joke basically connect dot became good job one fateful day girl come office gruesomely end life launch sosie journey madness slowly seeing thing life haunted voice past whatever know greatest pain exploit mystery completely satisfying solve constant moment jerky jumpscares definitely make feel edge particularly like uneasy camera work afraid linger long within frame add dutch angle play like cinema frame make squirm though much scare telegraphed slasher gory flick really psychological mind bender mentioned resolution make happy really watching someone work mental illness interesting movie
"I think this film's getting a little more credit than it deserves. There's a sense in which the threat in it is a metaphor for PTSD, but there's also a very straightforward ""It Follows""/""The Ring"" rip-off going on, and these two elements directly clash. The film spends a lot of time on things that ultimately have no impact on the plot, so it goes into the climax having not really mapped out the nature of the threat. It's unclear what it is or what would defeat it, and elements of both ideas crash into each other resulting in a fairly incoherent conclusion that seems to suggest that childhood trauma is completely insurmountable.It's not a bad film. The horror sequences are mostly well-constructed and the atmosphere of creeping doubt is compelling. But, oddly enough, the central hook that the film is named for is one of those elements that is ultimately irrelevant.",think film getting little credit deserves sense threat metaphor ptsd also straightforward follows ring rip going two element directly clash film spends lot time thing ultimately impact plot go climax really mapped nature threat unclear would defeat element idea crash resulting fairly incoherent conclusion seems suggest childhood trauma completely insurmountable bad film horror sequence mostly well constructed atmosphere creeping doubt compelling oddly enough central hook film named one element ultimately irrelevant
"Sosie Bacon plays an incompetent therapist who mutters platitudes and stands about doing precisely nothing while bad things happen to her patients.After demonstrating her inability to administer basic first aid to anyone within a fifty mile radius, she catches a case of the spooks. The spooks then follow her around being all creepy and not doing much, perhaps as an ironic form of mockery. None of the characters, supernatural or otherwise, seem to be any good at their jobs.This is dimwitted nonsense, but it's excellently produced. Decent acting, good cinematography, tight editing and engaging direction. It's a good time, despite the braindead characters, copy-paste writing, appalling dialogue and endless cliches. It's an amusing and occassionally effective pulpy jumpy horror - a highly polished turd that is so shiny you stop noticing the smell.Worth a watch, once, just for fun.",sosie bacon play incompetent therapist mutter platitude stand precisely nothing bad thing happen patient demonstrating inability administer basic first aid anyone within fifty mile radius catch case spook spook follow around creepy much perhaps ironic form mockery none character supernatural otherwise seem good job dimwitted nonsense excellently produced decent acting good cinematography tight editing engaging direction good time despite braindead character copy paste writing appalling dialogue endless cliche amusing occassionally effective pulpy jumpy horror highly polished turd shiny stop noticing smell worth watch fun
"I can't stop smiling at the mastery of filmmaking on display in Smile. The directing is topnotch. All of the technical aspects are pristine, especially the sound design. The musical score greatly enhances the mood. Even something as simple as transition shots are stunning. It's visually elite.I can't stop smiling at how ridiculously scary this movie is. I'm a 37-year-old man who has seen hundreds of horror flicks of all types. And yet this movie had me on edge from beginning to end. At points I was paranoid that someone was standing off to the side in the shadows of the theater. It continued afterwards, when I was startled by what turned out to be the shadow of the car behind me. And then again when the curbside lady brought my food out. I can't remember the last time a movie did this to me.I can't stop smiling at stumbling upon what might be my favorite movie of the year. I went in, as usual, without watching any trailers or looking up reviews/ratings. I had no expectations and was fully blown away. I was either smiling or had my jaw dropped for most of the runtime.I can't stop smiling at how impactful some of these scenes and moments are. I will never forget them. They are seared into my brain forever. Whoever came up with them, whoever designed them has to be some combination of genius and possibly disturbed. I love it. Maybe I'm disturbed too.I jumped about 20 times. None of the jump scares are cheap. They are all creative and earned. The few that are predictable still startle. I sometimes laughed afterwards at how bad it got me.I had a blast with Smile. It's not for the faint of heart or horror novices. For everyone else, for horror fans, for people who want high-quality cinema, this is the movie for you.

"You never know when it's your turn, to watch another being squirm, as they shuffle off their coil, passing on to you turmoil, which will overwhelm and steal, all your passion and your zeal, just no way to grin and bear it, there's no escape, until you wear it.A reasonably original take on a very generic horror theme with an often used metaphor, but the performance from Sosie Bacon is noteworthy and convincing, as is the escalation, with one or two genuine jump scare moments ratcheting up the tension and keeping you engaged enough to hope for more. The special effects are fine and the potential for parts 2, 3 and more in the near future left beaming right back at you as the titles role.",never know turn watch another squirm shuffle coil passing turmoil overwhelm steal passion zeal way grin bear escape wear reasonably original take generic horror theme often used metaphor performance sosie bacon noteworthy convincing escalation one two genuine jump scare moment ratcheting tension keeping engaged enough hope special effect fine potential part near future left beaming right back title role
"Smile (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of in theatres last night. The storyline follows a psychologist in an emergency center that one day receives a unique patient who recently witnessed her college professor commit suicide. She claims something is following her and she is experiencing and seeing strange things. The doctor tries to talk her down but the woman goes from crazy, to still to killing herself with a blunt object. As the doctor tries to deal with the tragedy she notices that she is starting to experience and see strange things...This movie is written and directed by Parker Finn in his directorial debut and stars Sosie Bacon (Scream: The Series), Jessie T. Usher (The Boys), Kyle Gallner (Scream 5), Caitlin Stasey (I, Frankenstein) and Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle).This movie is very, very unique and has everything a horror genre fan is looking for. The storyline is a healthy mix of It Follows and The Conjuring. The writing is outstanding and the main character is developed perfectly - the sub plots of the dynamics of her upbringing are well told as is the nature of her relationship ship with her fiancé and her ex. Those aspects are done just enough but not too much. The scene executions are so good. There's a birthday party scene that cracked me up and was so fun. I also adored the drool scene, the mother/unveiling of the creature...and the fire sequence was well executed. There's honestly some well done jump scares in here too. The cinematography and setup of scenes in this movie are very, very good and the full circle ending was perfect.Overall, this is a brilliant addition to the horror genre that I would score a 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend.",smile movie wife caught advanced screening theatre last night storyline follows psychologist emergency center one day receives unique patient recently witnessed college professor commit suicide claim something following experiencing seeing strange thing doctor try talk woman go crazy still killing blunt object doctor try deal tragedy notice starting experience see strange thing movie written directed parker finn directorial debut star sosie bacon scream series jessie usher boy kyle gallner scream caitlin stasey frankenstein kal penn harold kumar go white castle movie unique everything horror genre fan looking storyline healthy mix follows conjuring writing outstanding main character developed perfectly sub plot dynamic upbringing well told nature relationship ship fianc ex aspect done enough much scene execution good birthday party scene cracked fun also adored drool scene mother unveiling creature fire sequence well executed honestly well done jump scare cinematography setup scene movie good full circle ending perfect overall brilliant addition horror genre would score strongly recommend
"First off, salute to the director and writer. In the wrong hands, this could have easily fallen into complete silliness.Secondly, the movie doesn't cater to the PG13 crowd. It felt more real. The character acts and reacts in a genuine way we would all react if some insane situation arose.Third, it was a smooth ride. No real filler or derailing of the tense plot.So, what's the problem? It's the last 15 or so minutes. It goes in a random direction. An under devoped detail, which is more like an afterthought throughout, ends up front and center as the solution. It wasn't interesting and it wasn't the right way to go. I will say that the very last scene does give us a good payoff, though.Bottom line: I'd definitely recommend it. I think most viewers will really enjoy the bulk of the movie. I'm certain plenty of you will disagree with me regarding the ending and like it just fine. A solid 7 of 8 overall.",first salute director writer wrong hand could easily fallen complete silliness secondly movie cater pg crowd felt real character act reacts genuine way would react insane situation arose third smooth ride real filler derailing tense plot problem last minute go random direction devoped detail like afterthought throughout end front center solution interesting right way go say last scene give u good payoff though bottom line definitely recommend think viewer really enjoy bulk movie certain plenty disagree regarding ending like fine solid overall
"This little gem goes to show you that even the simplest of concepts, executed properly, can have the greatest success. I can't think of any seasoned filmmakers, given this concept, could've pulled it off as well as this was.In a nutshell, the horror in this film - a simple smile, just shouldn't have worked, but it did, and it did in a big way, only because of perfect directing, excellent cinematography, and the outstanding score. The real shocker here, is this was all put together buy an amateur filmmaker, Parker Finn, who wrote and directed this, his first feature film, based on one of his only two prior short films. So yeah, this near perfect gem is from an unexperienced newb filmmaker, and Finn has left his mark in this genre as the filmmaker to watch out for. Clearly, Sosie Bacon's spot-on performance helped seal the deal, but also note that her cast direction was from the same new inexperienced filmmaker.The pacing, albeit slow - which I'm not a fan of, actually worked perfectly in setting the film's tone. The nearly two-hour long runtime flew by. Along with the score that couldn't have been any better, and the sharp and intelligent cinematography, this film worked in every way to keep your heart pumping and your mind stressing. Surprisingly, there were even a few good jump-scares, a rarity for me. Even the special effects and prosthetics were top shelf.I've had this film on my radar for some time, but after seeing the trailer and rolling my eyes that this horror film is basically based on characters smiling, I laughed it off for many months, especially when I knew it was filmed by a no-name filmmaker. The only reason I finally decided to watch it, was from many of my friends raving how awesome it was. I'm sure glad I finally watched it, and recommend anyone who loves horror, thriller and mystery films to see this as well. I can't wait to see what Finn comes up with next.",little gem go show even simplest concept executed properly greatest success think seasoned filmmaker given concept could pulled well nutshell horror film simple smile worked big way perfect directing excellent cinematography outstanding score real shocker put together buy amateur filmmaker parker finn wrote directed first feature film based one two prior short film yeah near perfect gem unexperienced newb filmmaker finn left mark genre filmmaker watch clearly sosie bacon spot performance helped seal deal also note cast direction new inexperienced filmmaker pacing albeit slow fan actually worked perfectly setting film tone nearly two hour long runtime flew along score better sharp intelligent cinematography film worked every way keep heart pumping mind stressing surprisingly even good jump scare rarity even special effect prosthetics top shelf film radar time seeing trailer rolling eye horror film basically based character smiling laughed many month especially knew filmed name filmmaker reason finally decided watch many friend raving awesome sure glad finally watched recommend anyone love horror thriller mystery film see well wait see finn come next
"Smile is a new horror film directed and written by Parker Finn. After some short films, this is only his first real directing work.The film is about psychologist Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) who learns about a dark evil after a traumatic event with a new patient.This same evil continues to frighten and endanger her after this event. To stop this evil, she must learn its origins, but in doing so she is confronted with her own traumatic past.Film studio Paramount has tried to keep this film a bit of a secret and only promoted it with a hidden teaser on some films. Once the trailer hit the internet, it received a lot of positive attention. Because of this, the film studio decided to release the film in theaters, because at first the film would only be released on their streaming service. For example, they eventually had novice director Parker Finn direct this film and had it come up with a suitable story.For a first film, Parker Finn manages to portray the film beautifully and appropriately. He knows how to create creative transitions between some scenes. The images can only come across as somewhat familiar to horror fans, because many scenes come across in similar ways to scenes from other films, especially well-known horror films.Despite Parker Finn's good work, Paramount could have arranged for some extra people to give him some extra support. The story of the film is good, but not really original. Horror connoisseurs can quickly compare the story with stories from other horror films such as The Ring of It Follows. For example, the film can at times become a bit predictable for horror connoisseurs, who can then roughly predict what will happen in the film and thus anticipate the story itself.Parker Finn knows how to create a good tension with the way in which he manages to portray things together with an appropriate soundtrack and further frightening sounds. Unfortunately, this often only leads to a simple jump scare. After the umpteenth time, this can start to seem faint rather than being really scary. This allows the film to lose its tension level a bit.Parker Finn does try to bring out some other horror ways during the end of the film, but these are no longer as strong or frightening. If he had been more creative earlier in the movie with different horror elements, the movie could have been better and scarier. Around the end, he also seems to lose some of his focus, so that all of a sudden everything happens and seems to be possible.Despite the fact that Sosie Baconmeer is known as a TV actress, she knows how to deliver good and appropriate acting in this film. She comes across as someone who continues to be plagued by evil and must try to relive her traumatic past. She knows how to carry the film well, because the rest of the film cast is also more actors from TV series or small film roles. Most of them play their roles well, but with most of their characters it is possible to predict what will happen to them.",smile new horror film directed written parker finn short film first real directing work film psychologist rose cotter sosie bacon learns dark evil traumatic event new patient evil continues frighten endanger event stop evil must learn origin confronted traumatic past film studio paramount tried keep film bit secret promoted hidden teaser film trailer hit internet received lot positive attention film studio decided release film theater first film would released streaming service example eventually novice director parker finn direct film come suitable story first film parker finn manages portray film beautifully appropriately know create creative transition scene image come across somewhat familiar horror fan many scene come across similar way scene film especially well known horror film despite parker finn good work paramount could arranged extra people give extra support story film good really original horror connoisseur quickly compare story story horror film ring follows example film time become bit predictable horror connoisseur roughly predict happen film thus anticipate story parker finn know create good tension way manages portray thing together appropriate soundtrack frightening sound unfortunately often lead simple jump scare umpteenth time start seem faint rather really scary allows film lose tension level bit parker finn try bring horror way end film longer strong frightening creative earlier movie different horror element movie could better scarier around end also seems lose focus sudden everything happens seems possible despite fact sosie baconmeer known tv actress know deliver good appropriate acting film come across someone continues plagued evil must try relive traumatic past know carry film well rest film cast also actor tv series small film role play role well character possible predict happen
"This movie had me scared and on edge from start to finish. It's been a long time since I saw a horror movie this good.The story is a bit cliche at some points, but it is well written and well made most of the time. The acting is great as well, which is not always a common thing when it comes to horror movies. It is very well directed and the atmosphere is really eerie.The first girl to die in the movie probably had the most unpleasent smile I have seen in maybe my whole life. Especially when the therapist started seeing her in the darkness as an hallucination. That really gave me the chills. Then there were some smiles that was not very scary, like the patient Carl. The pacing of the movie was excellent. It got more and more creepy as the story progressed. The ending really etched into my brain, and I actually thought I was gonna have nightmares that night, which does not happen to me very often. The day after I saw this movie, a car passed me by, and the old man driving looked at me and smiled... The only thing I could think about was this movie.This was Parker Finn's first feature film. I really hope he makes more films like this one. A good start on his writing/directing career. Well done!",movie scared edge start finish long time since saw horror movie good story bit cliche point well written well made time acting great well always common thing come horror movie well directed atmosphere really eerie first girl die movie probably unpleasent smile seen maybe whole life especially therapist started seeing darkness hallucination really gave chill smile scary like patient carl pacing movie excellent got creepy story progressed ending really etched brain actually thought gonna nightmare night happen often day saw movie car passed old man driving looked smiled thing could think movie parker finn first feature film really hope make film like one good start writing directing career well done
"Smile obsesses over saturating every moment in unsettling dread. The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile's premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.",smile ob saturating every moment unsettling dread score sound effect make every moment uneasy uncomfortable good way smile premise bore many similarity follows much poorer execution smile stumbled jump scare jump scare started closing eye jump scare predictable tired disturbing image screamed face say sosie bacon excellent job given performance bright spot film unfortunately movie unimpressive tried cloak mediocrity fountain jump scare stressful noise unpleasant moment
"SmileFor lovers of the horror genre this was a treat from start to finish. Sosie Bacon who played Dr Rose Cotter, the shrink, was perfectly cast, never off the screen and the camera work was up close and personal. It really was a great acting performance in a horror role, nuanced, varied and very intense, we were certainly rooting for her!The script was tight and everything was sacrificed for the narrative impetus, the mark of classic horror.Without spoiling this movie there was a very similar plot in an original Star Trek episode, I will let the sci-fi wonks identify this similarity.Overall it was a great night out and I couldn't guess the conclusion.

Its actually aswell belonga to one of the more better ending to a horrormovie.I watched it at the cinema and yes people (including me) got actually a bit scared.

"""Smile"" is a film that has a spectacular art direction, its interior and exterior locations are well achieved, from looking calm to being gloomy. The performances are good, highlighting those of Sosie Bacon and Kyle Gallner. The problem is in its script that is not entirely original, we have a mix between the story of ""The Ring"" together with ""It Follows"" and even elements of the lousy movie ""Truth or Dare"", the result is nice but it doesn't come furthermore, some scenes are drawn out and become predictable, the story's formula of a curse being passed from one person to another is losing its charm.

"Do you remember the movie ""It Follows""? Smile reminds me a lot about that movie. The plot is very similar, something is passed on from one victim to another. The creepiness and terror are also very much alike. It's pretty terrifying, even though it doesn't use that many jump scares. Unlike other horror movies which primarily relying on jump scares to get the audiences hooked. The plot is rather predictable, I could already guess the ending halfway through the movie. But even then, I didn't get bored. It must be the way the director made the movie engaging. The only reason I didn't give it 7 stars is because I hate unsettled endings. I like horror movies where the protagonist survives and defeats the source of problem. That's the only reason I gave it 6 stars.",remember movie follows smile reminds lot movie plot similar something passed one victim another creepiness terror also much alike pretty terrifying even though use many jump scare unlike horror movie primarily relying jump scare get audience hooked plot rather predictable could already guess ending halfway movie even get bored must way director made movie engaging reason give star hate unsettled ending like horror movie protagonist survives defeat source problem reason gave star
"Just came back after a viewing of this & wow, this film is one of the examples of Trailers looking better than the actual film itself.The film sees a mental health doctor who after witnesses a suicide of a patient right in front of her eyes who grins in a sinister way & describes a supernatural force prior. However, this entity has soon attached itself to her & begins to ruin every aspect of her life. She must investigate in order to stop whatever it is that has attached itself to her.I found the film to be mostly boring. Ok, it had some gory, creepy & sinister moments in it, but, for a film with such a basic & thin premise with little to no depth, it was too long!!! 1 hour & 50 minutes!! The film could've easily have been 30 minutes shorter fro crying out loud!The story & it's premise was so basic & out there that it wasn't even that intriguing! The trailer made the film seem better than it actually was sadly! The ending man, the ending was just out there!! The film dragged on for literally nothing & why!? It! Makes! No! Sense!Also, the death of the cat was unneeded as well as other stuff...! You know what I mean...!Overall, it's simple unimaginative story & concept that's a wannabe of Truth or Dare, which is far better by the way!

"This movie just gave me hell of a ride the whole time. All I can say is Amazing . It was suspenseful, thrilling. Like Rose, I was kind of digging too. I was eager to know what's happening around her. Was it just her hallucinations or real? She is also a therapist, so seeing her getting through this makes me wonder how she is going to deal with this.Though it looked like hallucination at first but it doesn't seem to be hallucination at last. Then what's this? Around 20 people have gone through same situation and the pattern they followed is same too. So,what's really going on?Is really a curse which is passing from person to person??It was really good but ending is juat unsatisfactory to me. I really wanted to know how it all starts. But,it ends without any answer.",movie gave hell ride whole time say amazing suspenseful thrilling like rose kind digging eager know happening around hallucination real also therapist seeing getting make wonder going deal though looked like hallucination first seem hallucination last around people gone situation pattern followed really going really curse passing person person really good ending juat unsatisfactory really wanted know start end without answer

"One of very few horror movies that managed to surprise me this year. When the trailer came out, I thought it was gonna be another dumb, incompetent mess.I was proved wrong.From the very start, everything from the directing, performances to the cinematography and sound design were absolute stunning. How a low budget managed this feat was beyond me but the film was simply mesmerizing to look at.The horror was quite effective with jumpscares and dreadful moments, albeit some cheap ones but not that distracting. They were able to build up the tension so well and never intended to tone it down right till the very end. The plot was simple enough to interlink all relevant characters to make me care about them, although some could complain 90% of the characters were just filler and I might agree with that. However, the protagonist was good enough to carry the whole show.One thing that may not sit well with a lot of audience was the use of mental illness. Smile handled it decently but don't expect Oscar worthy exposition. And no, it wasn't exactly the main theme so try not to quit halfway through because there would be surprises by the last act of the film.Give it a go. I'd say it was well worth the time for horror fans like myself. This was not just some Annabelle or Insidious sequels but something more.",one horror movie managed surprise year trailer came thought gonna another dumb incompetent mess proved wrong start everything directing performance cinematography sound design absolute stunning low budget managed feat beyond film simply mesmerizing look horror quite effective jumpscares dreadful moment albeit cheap one distracting able build tension well never intended tone right till end plot simple enough interlink relevant character make care although could complain character filler might agree however protagonist good enough carry whole show one thing may sit well lot audience use mental illness smile handled decently expect oscar worthy exposition exactly main theme try quit halfway would surprise last act film give go say well worth time horror fan like annabelle insidious sequel something
"What an incredible year for horror!The intro scene is conceptually perfect. Why? Because it immediately gives us all that we need to get into the context of the film, not only in terms of the most classic horror elements but also in terms of its main themes. All this before its title card. But how? Introducing us immediately to our main character, Dr Rose Cotter, who works in a psychiatric hospital and who receives a visit from a new patient who in ten minutes shows strange behaviour, claims to be being followed by an evil entity, smiles scarily and commits suicide. And now that curse seems to have passed on to our Dr., who is impeccably played by Sosie Bacon, in one of those roles where she often has to balance herself on the boundary that separates what everyone sees and what only she can see.Trauma. It will always be traumatic to witness an event as dramatic and violent as a suicide. And it is from trauma that this entity feeds. And how well this theme is used... after all, many of us have gone through traumas and traumas are just kept in a hidden corner within us, always ready to be reactivated. Grief and guilt are often associated with traumatic events, and Smile does not deny that connection. Nor does it refuse to make connections with psychological and mental problems that can arise from it and how when this happens, the victim becomes even more placed on the sidelines, more isolated, more alone in a world from which one does not intend to move away but from which finds no other alternative.But of course, this is a horror movie and it's not only about the message that a film of the genre should live. Good news: even if you don't care about meaning, Smile is pretty good and effective entertainment. The suspenseful scenes are very well constructed, the environment feels heavy for long moments and it presents us with several jump scares that work perfectly, being this one of the scariest films of recent years.The film suffers from a certain predictability typical of the genre - I saw that ending coming from miles away - and, at times, it seems to rely a little too much on the power of suggestion and the effectiveness of its scares, although there are reasons for that because those are two areas where it stands out. The visual effects - mostly practical - are not present for long moments, but when they appear they elevate the work, with some really terrifying images. And as for Parker Finn...what a great movie debut, not only because of the way he leaves us on edge thanks to a very safe direction but also for presenting some elements that we don't often see in horror in terms of the originality of shots and scene transitions.2022 doesn't stop giving us good horror. Smile bets on a heavy atmosphere, strong messages and very effective scares to give us one of the tensest films of the year. A little bit The Ring, a little bit It Follows, but also a very own identity that should ensure this will not stop here.",incredible year horror intro scene conceptually perfect immediately give u need get context film term classic horror element also term main theme title card introducing u immediately main character dr rose cotter work psychiatric hospital receives visit new patient ten minute show strange behaviour claim followed evil entity smile scarily commits suicide curse seems passed dr impeccably played sosie bacon one role often balance boundary separate everyone see see trauma always traumatic witness event dramatic violent suicide trauma entity feed well theme used many u gone trauma trauma kept hidden corner within u always ready reactivated grief guilt often associated traumatic event smile deny connection refuse make connection psychological mental problem arise happens victim becomes even placed sideline isolated alone world one intend move away find alternative course horror movie message film genre live good news even care meaning smile pretty good effective entertainment suspenseful scene well constructed environment feel heavy long moment present u several jump scare work perfectly one scariest film recent year film suffers certain predictability typical genre saw ending coming mile away time seems rely little much power suggestion effectiveness scare although reason two area stand visual effect mostly practical present long moment appear elevate work really terrifying image parker finn great movie debut way leaf u edge thanks safe direction also presenting element often see horror term originality shot scene transition stop giving u good horror smile bet heavy atmosphere strong message effective scare give u one tensest film year little bit ring little bit follows also identity ensure stop
"Pretty disappointed overall! Yeah the case is pretty interesting when we try to know more about the curse that the young woman have and we learn also more about it. Its transmit when there is a trauma and to get rid of it we need to kill someone else. So yeah thats pretty it. I mean at the end, the monster was very well made and have a scary face and proportions. But except that its only jumpscares, dreams, music who play a dissonnant rythm and thats all. We have all the cliché here: a woman lose her job because she is possessed by something since the young lady killed herself in front of her. And we have the separation from her sister, husband and even her psy. The jumpscares are there but the story was pretty simple and to know more about the possession trough the other cases is good but clearly not enough to hide all the classic parts of an horror movie. I did like the sound design and it really give the tension when its needed but beside that its classic and not so interesting honestly.

"Very decent horror movie kinda dating back to the mid/late 2000s.

"Straight up, the trailer for this looked like a joke; like something you'd see on SNL. We previously had Truth or Dare with demons with creepy smiles, but at least that movie had enough substance to stand on its own. This movie has nothing. Padded throughout we have a mystery we don't care about because we know the beats; we've seen this plot so so so many different times. We also get the lacklustre, conveyer belt jump scares we've seen a million times, and to top it off we get the yawn inducing family drama to make you feel like you're actually watching a movie, and it was putting me to sleep. If this movie was meant to be a wink wink type of horror movie then don't make it this serious. And if you are trying to make something like this serious then there's a way to also make it come off as satirical to the horror genre. I don't know what this movies' direction was. Was this made to help the studio write off something on their taxes? Was it some directorial debut for a director or lead actor?, cause it didn't do them any favours. Most fun I got out of it was laughing at it, and feeling embarrassed for those who actually took this thing seriously. 4 out of 10.",straight trailer looked like joke like something see snl previously truth dare demon creepy smile least movie enough substance stand movie nothing padded throughout mystery care know beat seen plot many different time also get lacklustre conveyer belt jump scare seen million time top get yawn inducing family drama make feel like actually watching movie putting sleep movie meant wink wink type horror movie make serious trying make something like serious way also make come satirical horror genre know movie direction made help studio write something tax directorial debut director lead actor cause favour fun got laughing feeling embarrassed actually took thing seriously
"Anything you ""need"" to see is in the trailer.None of the main characters were likable. I don't know why, but I didn't like Rose. I really disliked her boyfriend. Everyone else was pretty bland.The movie is extremely predictable. As soon as I saw the cat, I knew it was a goner. When the kid opened his present, you knew what was coming.The ending was easy to guess, but then there was a ""fake out."" I thought, ""Oh, I guessed that wrong. That's good!"" However, to align with everything else in the movie, the script took a predictable turn back to my initial thoughts.I was looking forward to this movie, but when it was over, I realized I should have been satisfied with the trailer.This is a movie that could have been good, but wasn't...for many, many reasons.",anything need see trailer none main character likable know like rose really disliked boyfriend everyone else pretty bland movie extremely predictable soon saw cat knew goner kid opened present knew coming ending easy guess fake thought oh guessed wrong good however align everything else movie script took predictable turn back initial thought looking forward movie realized satisfied trailer movie could good many many reason
"If you don't think about the plot holes and how normal people would behave, then this movie is pretty good. The problem is that I have a brain and I use it, so I didn't like this movie. This is one of those movies where in order for the movie to move forward, everyone has to behave in a way that would never actually happen. Trained psychologists have to be oblivious to the obvious. Cops need to be totally incompetent and oblivious as well.The protagonist is extremely unlikable, but the movie tries to convince me that I should be rooting for her. This movie tells me that she's not crazy, but the character acts totally insane. There's a strange disconnect between what the movie wants me to think and what it shows me. There are jump scares that have nothing to do with the movie and come out of nowhere just for the sake of adding a jump scare.To top everything off, it's extremely predictable and I saw the ending coming from a mile away. It wasn't scary either. I found everything quite boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who's like me and can't turn their brain off. I gave it 3 stars because it's shot well enough and it had a foreboding atmosphere. The acting was okay. There were only a couple of times where I felt removed from the movie because the acting reminded me that I'm watching an actor instead of their character.",think plot hole normal people would behave movie pretty good problem brain use like movie one movie order movie move forward everyone behave way would never actually happen trained psychologist oblivious obvious cop need totally incompetent oblivious well protagonist extremely unlikable movie try convince rooting movie tell crazy character act totally insane strange disconnect movie want think show jump scare nothing movie come nowhere sake adding jump scare top everything extremely predictable saw ending coming mile away scary either found everything quite boring recommend movie anyone like turn brain gave star shot well enough foreboding atmosphere acting okay couple time felt removed movie acting reminded watching actor instead character
"Came to Smile after watching a trailer of it and thought, at last a horror movie which might live up to the hype.Sosie Bacon's psychiatrist sees a young, clearly psychotic woman who claims to be seeing an entity everywhere who is smiling. The episode does not end well and Dr Cotter, clearly shaken, resorts to drinking when at home awaiting her fiancÃ©. On the surface Cotter's life is good. She has a responsible job, a beautiful home and a supposedly supportive partner. As the film progresses, predictably, things go to hell as does Dr Cotter. The jumps and shocks continue at a pace and get worse, if anything until the film reaches its climax.A good horror movie with plenty of jump scares which owes many of its ideas to The Shining (the madness of the situation and cinematography), It Follows, Insidious and The Ring. The use of rather subtle music cues and voices is clever.",came smile watching trailer thought last horror movie might live hype sosie bacon psychiatrist see young clearly psychotic woman claim seeing entity everywhere smiling episode end well dr cotter clearly shaken resort drinking home awaiting fianc surface cotter life good responsible job beautiful home supposedly supportive partner film progress predictably thing go hell dr cotter jump shock continue pace get worse anything film reach climax good horror movie plenty jump scare owes many idea shining madness situation cinematography follows insidious ring use rather subtle music cue voice clever
"It's definitely an ok movie if you find yourself with your partner on a Friday night and want a bit of a spook but don't hope for too much. Spoilers in here so consider before reading further.The premise is simple enough, it's a chain of 'suicides' in which some evil entity haunts a person to near total insanity, then possesses them at the end and causes them to commit suicide in front of another person, a witness, thereby traumatising the witness and creating some type of link through the trauma that allows the entity to attach to the witness and repeat the haunting with them culminating in the same result over and over and over.So, what are the issues:1. Nothing new is introduced here - nothing ground break or original - it doesn't matter whether it's the exorcist, Michael Myers, Jason, Freddie, Byebye man, slender man, or whatever, there's always some inexplicable evil force that has no explained origin or motive that simply hunts and haunts. This is more of the same only this time in the end you see something that looks like a super tall skinny/lanky American Indian type thing with bad teeth.2. The premise - a chain of suicides - does a reasonable job of presenting tension, since you learn quickly that each time it happens the witness survives 4-7 days, and the haunting gets worse. However, much of what happened was predictable, everything from the fate of the cat - which I guessed quickly, to the therapist etc. You could kind of work out the rhythm of the haunting. It's not bad, but again, it's not original or amazing.3. The big issue - nobody ever seems capable of explaining what is going on in these types of movies - despite the fact that she has collected evidence, has a therapist, works with therapists, she can't seem to clearly articulate what is happening and that there is a train of evidence that points to some pretty unusual coincidences that might be worth some consideration by these people, if only as part of learning about her situation so as to offer counselling. Yep, this is one of those movies where the dumbness of the protagonist is what drives the possibility of the horror. She can't seem to make sane explanations to anyone and decides to manage most of it alone.4. The ending was hugely predictable - you realise quite quickly that, if you are going to commit suicide in 4-7 days in front of a single witness then the best hopeful way of postponing or preventing that is going somewhere so remote that there is no one around to see you. Let's at least explore what might happen then, you ask yourself. But no. It was obvious when we saw the cop ex phone her as she headed to the old cabin that the GPS in her phone would send him to her and the chain cycles again. I was literally eye rolling at this point.Rather than consider new ground, 'what happens if she does successfully lock herself away', instead, the writers go for the super easy option so that they can come out with Smile 2 next year. I'm just waiting to see if they try to launch this evil entity by giving it a cool name and making it sound ominous. It wasn't ominious, I wasn't afraid, personally I felt like if it was after me I'd be very capable of rationally explaining what was happening to my friends, family, and medical professionals, asking them to consider that I'm ill and challenging them to test it by observing me in a lab or some such in a group on camera whilst restrained for days on end to see what happens. Aside from that, the evil entity wasn't scary, it's simply trying to possess the person, so I'd equally be inclined to tell it to F off. I just didn't feel intimidated, I'd be more concerned about being cornered by 5 drunk homeless people on a Friday at 3 am.Anyhow, as I said at the opening, if you want some horror candy to watch, this does the job. It's vanilla flavour with no hidden inner delight, but it will get you by.",definitely ok movie find partner friday night want bit spook hope much spoiler consider reading premise simple enough chain suicide evil entity haunt person near total insanity posse end cause commit suicide front another person witness thereby traumatising witness creating type link trauma allows entity attach witness repeat haunting culminating result issue nothing new introduced nothing ground break original matter whether exorcist michael myers jason freddie byebye man slender man whatever always inexplicable evil force explained origin motive simply hunt haunt time end see something look like super tall skinny lanky american indian type thing bad teeth premise chain suicide reasonable job presenting tension since learn quickly time happens witness survives day haunting get worse however much happened predictable everything fate cat guessed quickly therapist etc could kind work rhythm haunting bad original amazing big issue nobody ever seems capable explaining going type movie despite fact collected evidence therapist work therapist seem clearly articulate happening train evidence point pretty unusual coincidence might worth consideration people part learning situation offer counselling yep one movie dumbness protagonist drive possibility horror seem make sane explanation anyone decides manage alone ending hugely predictable realise quite quickly going commit suicide day front single witness best hopeful way postponing preventing going somewhere remote one around see let least explore might happen ask obvious saw cop ex phone headed old cabin gps phone would send chain cycle literally eye rolling point rather consider new ground happens successfully lock away instead writer go super easy option come smile next year waiting see try launch evil entity giving cool name making sound ominous ominious afraid personally felt like capable rationally explaining happening friend family medical professional asking consider ill challenging test observing lab group camera whilst restrained day end see happens aside evil entity scary simply trying posse person equally inclined tell f feel intimidated concerned cornered drunk homeless people friday anyhow said opening want horror candy watch job vanilla flavour hidden inner delight get
"It didn't appeal to me at first, but after seeing the trailer and reading the positive reviews, I decided to watch it out of curiosity and I really liked it. I was expecting a boring or mediocre psychological horror movie, but this movie sold me. The story is quite good and it feels fresh as it seems to be taken from a novel. It works quite well as a psychological thriller since it has moments that generate tension, it takes its time for some scares and the soundtrack does its job very well in the atmosphere for tense moments. It has good plans and a good direction. The end is also indescribable and worthy of a story of this type. I know that anyone is not going to understand this movie, but since I take literature classes and write horror stories, I must say that this movie is an excellent example that psychological horror can still be made from a strong and intelligent way. A movie that is recommended to anyone who is a movie fan and is looking for something with an unconventional plot. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",appeal first seeing trailer reading positive review decided watch curiosity really liked expecting boring mediocre psychological horror movie movie sold story quite good feel fresh seems taken novel work quite well psychological thriller since moment generate tension take time scare soundtrack job well atmosphere tense moment good plan good direction end also indescribable worthy story type know anyone going understand movie since take literature class write horror story must say movie excellent example psychological horror still made strong intelligent way movie recommended anyone movie fan looking something unconventional plot final rating movie
"I really expected the movie to live up to the hype it was portraying. Hopefully this is not the directors first and only movie filmed cause if it is, I'm giving up before getting started. The buildup was not bad. Plot and Climax was mediocre. Very underwhelming acting. I will say the ending was decent. Was not expecting it. I put this under more of a psychological thriller then horror. I caught MAYBE three jump scares. Quite a bit of gore which I don't mind but it seemed to be trying to give off a message that I feel this day and age society won't grasp. I personally don't recommend it but to each their own.

"I'm not a big fan of horrors, for the simple fact that most are just plain stupid, have a non existant story or characters that are just dumb and you hope they get killed off as soon as possible.Smile, actually - was quite enjoyable, as far as horrors go. The scares were well done, there were lots of tense scenes, there was a decent enough story line with only 1 wooden actor that sadly wasn't taken out. We as the audience were actually rooting for the main character, we wanted to know if she would figure out some way to solve the puzzle of what happened to her patient.Unfortunately the ending just turned it into another generic horror ending, and I left the cinema feeling quite let down after having enjoyed the first 98% of the film before that.",big fan horror simple fact plain stupid non existant story character dumb hope get killed soon possible smile actually quite enjoyable far horror go scare well done lot tense scene decent enough story line wooden actor sadly taken audience actually rooting main character wanted know would figure way solve puzzle happened patient unfortunately ending turned another generic horror ending left cinema feeling quite let enjoyed first film
"9.1/10My assumptions for this film was that it would be repetitive with a bunch of cheap jump scares, and a story that would be a whirlwind of boredom. Almost similar to ""Truth or Dare"".While this film was filled with a bunch of jump scares. They were executed in such a way that my anxiety was shooting through the roof. While ""Barbarian"" was able to spook me a bit. This film has my heart still racing an hour after the film has ended which is very uncommon for me.Sound was crucial to film being a hit or miss, and in my books, it was a huge hit. The score did a great job of getting me hooked on certain scenes a bit too much that I hit a rollercoaster of emotions. When I finally recovered from one scene the next would have me reeling again.I've never seen Sosie Bacon before, but she had me hooked. The film depends heavily on her reacting to what was going on around her. She made the unbelievable believable. Delving deeper and deeper into a world of psychosis I felt I was losing my mind with her.Lastly, I want to say that I was pleased with pacing. I didn't look to see how long the film was, but at nearly two hours it steadily flew by. For me this was a complete film. It hit the ticks of enjoyment at good points and ends very well.Overall, this was quite the film. It reached into my mind and soul, twisted it, and then left it heart-pounding unpleasantness. There's great sound and some really good acting that hits the deepest part of the soul. I would definitely recommend checking this film out, especially in Ultra AVX with Dolby Atmos. The only thing I'll say is that if you're not easily scared you may not like it, but if you're easily scared it will definitely tickle a nerve. Somewhere in the middle you may go either way.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it gives you insight to the film without spoilers. Until next time....

"I must say, this film was quite a lot better that I thought it would be. And the famous scene from the trailer (the smiling patient) was so much more brutal than Imagined. There were some very unsettling scenes in this film. I took a star away in honor of poor ""Mustache"" and because of the ending, so depressing. The movie as a whole is a fairly disturbing look into a woman's fast descent into madness. Someone mentioned that it was influenced by ""It Follows"" and ""The Conjuring."" I can definitely see that, yet it is unique. I was a bit disappointed by the ending, despite the fact that it was well done. It was such a dark story and I guess I was hoping for a more enlightening conclusion. Far from it.

"I'm convinced all of these positive reviewers are being paid by Paramount to further promote this very mediocre film. I'm also convinced I watched a completely different movie than everyone else here.For starters, this film is once again entirely too long for what it is. I'm not sure why Hollywood thinks every movie that comes out these days has to be 2 hours or longer, but I guarantee this film could've been at least 30 minutes shorter, and taken absolutely nothing away from the story or the viewing experience. A majority of the film drags on and is quite boring at times, with lots of filler moments.Next, the so-called horror of it all. This film is not scary, and anyone claiming it to be ""the scariest movie"" like I've seen on numerous reviews clearly does not watch many movies, let alone horror. The ""smiling"" aspect is corny and unserious, despite best efforts. In my opinion, there are only two genuine jump scares, both of which are spoiled in trailers for the film (naturally).The story itself explores themes of generational trauma and mental illness, but unfortunately none of it is done in a way that is new or original. We've seen this story and these themes told a million times (and much better). The acting wasn't that bad, but it's also nothing to write home about. I will give points to sound design, as I do find it to be quite successful on its own, but as a collective, there are too many flaws to overlook here. And don't even get me started on this being yet another film with zero explanation for the cause of its events. Just because you leave things ""open to interpretation"" doesn't mean it's good or subversive! It just means your writing is lazy. Someone please tell Hollywood that. We're tired.I am a huge horror fan just as much as the next guy, but I went in to Smile with low expectations that were sadly proven correct. There are countless other 2022 horror films that are so much better than this. Barbarian, for example, is lightyears better and reaches heights that this film only wishes it could reach! Smile is like a much worse version of if It Follows and Hereditary had a baby. I don't recommend, and I have no plans to ever see this again.

"I was pretty hyped for this movie, not going to lie. I wasn't expecting some 11-time Oscar winning masterpiece, but I did expect an intense, edge-of-your-seat scarefest like that of 'Insidious' or 'Sinister', where the movie is dripping with creepy unsettlingness from start to finish. 'Smile' is not that. What 'Smile' does well is build up the jump scare, but unfortunately (and more importantly), 'Smile' forgets to deliver the scare in each of these sequences it repeats throughout its way overlong 2-hour runtime.Example, the main character will be staring down a dark hallway while the music tenses and camera slowly zooms in, and then the phone will ring SO LOUD. This is NOT a scare! This is just lazy and, above all, annoying. These ""jump scares"" happen throughout the ENTIRE movie and are extremely obnoxious. I can respect jump scares if there's actually something scary at the end of the build-up, not just an obnoxiously loud noise that has nothing to do with the tension that was just wasted. An example of an ACTUAL jump scare would be like when the Lipstick Demon appears at the table for the first time in 'Insidious'. THAT is a warranted jump scare.The plot of 'Smile' and the way the characters unravel it is almost identical to 'The Ring'. No new ground is broken, which was expected, but I at least expected a little more originality than a copy/paste story of 'The Ring' with a good amount of 'It Follows' copied as well, yet is far less than both those movies.What I thought was pretty good was the ending, when the demon finally reveals itself. The design of the demon and what it does to its victims is actually pretty great/gruesome. Unfortunately, by the time we're introduced to the Smile demon, the movie's over. Such a shame, as this movie could have been a balls-to-the-wall nail-biting chiller. The score for this movie was hands-down the best and creepiest part. The music reminded me of 'Sinister's music, as in there was something off about it, making it unnerving.Overall, this movie has been done before and done MUCH better. Has it's moments, but drags on without any scares for far too long.6/10.",pretty hyped movie going lie expecting time oscar winning masterpiece expect intense edge seat scarefest like insidious sinister movie dripping creepy unsettlingness start finish smile smile well build jump scare unfortunately importantly smile forgets deliver scare sequence repeat throughout way overlong hour runtime example main character staring dark hallway music tense camera slowly zoom phone ring loud scare lazy annoying jump scare happen throughout entire movie extremely obnoxious respect jump scare actually something scary end build obnoxiously loud noise nothing tension wasted example actual jump scare would like lipstick demon appears table first time insidious warranted jump scare plot smile way character unravel almost identical ring new ground broken expected least expected little originality copy paste story ring good amount follows copied well yet far le movie thought pretty good ending demon finally reveals design demon victim actually pretty great gruesome unfortunately time introduced smile demon movie shame movie could ball wall nail biting chiller score movie hand best creepiest part music reminded sinister music something making unnerving overall movie done done much better moment drag without scare far long

"Smile is the best movie I've seen this year and the scariest. It had a terrific story where the twists added up and had hardly any restraint.

The faces usually smilie and soon it consumes her to the point of suicide. She then researches this demonic situation to something more horrific. There were a few abrupt scenes that I would've like more of before it cuts to the next scene, but it was honestly disturbing and unexpected in its timing of scares.

"You never know what to expect with a new horror film, but as an original idea - not a sequel or reboot - Smile is a fun, chilling thrill ride which manages to get under your skin and stay there throughout it's two hour runtime.

Will she be able to save her? Or, will she have to save herself?

"Therapist Rose sees a young woman who, having witnessed a horrifying suicide, is terrified by people wearing scary smiles. Moments later she commits suicide, wearing a scary smile as she does so. Rose found her idea that some sort of evil entity was responsible somewhat far-fetched but now, as the same thing manifests around her, will she be able to convince others? And will she be able to figure things out and beat the curse/entity/whatever?This film reminded me of It Follows, which was about a sexually transmitted curse: there is a similar vibe here, and why not? It's a decent template, and it hasn't been overused.Different horror tropes work differently for people. This movie has some physical horror, a sense of dread, a couple of shock moments (the best one used in the trailer), loud sudden sounds and, most horrifying of all, the smiles. It's amazing how scary a smile can be.The largely unknown cast is good. And writer/director Parker Finn has done a great job on his first feature.

"When I first saw the trailer I thought there was no way it could be good. But this movie is surprisingly good. It's scary for sure. Yes, it bears a similar plot to It Follows. But, it accomplishes what It Follows could not. It's actually scary. And it actually reveals more about what the source of the events are. I don't know how anyone could say this movie was boring. It's creepy. Yes it uses a lot of jump scare tactics. So what. It works. I think it was better than the majority of horror movies out there. It's definitely worth a watch. I like the way the movie conflates mental illness with the supernatural. And the incorporation of trauma in the supernatural is quite a unique idea. At least I haven't seen it used before.",first saw trailer thought way could good movie surprisingly good scary sure yes bear similar plot follows accomplishes follows could actually scary actually reveals source event know anyone could say movie boring creepy yes us lot jump scare tactic work think better majority horror movie definitely worth watch like way movie conflates mental illness supernatural incorporation trauma supernatural quite unique idea least seen used
"""Smile"" is the scariest sh-t I've seen in a while. It's probably the scariest movie I've seen since ""Hereditary."" I gotta hand it to Parker Finn, he was in his bag. He took a known formula and suped it up to effectively give the audience something new. He had me squirming and on edge the whole time like a rollercoaster rider who knows the drop is coming but still has their heart in their throat once it happens.The basic premise is an oft-used one, and in fact, I thought this movie was going to be a different version of ""Truth or Dare"" (2018) which was not all that good. In ""Smile"" people were serially committing suicide only after they'd witnessed someone else commit suicide.A psychologist by the name of Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) witnessed a girl (Caitlin Stasey) commit suiced right in front of her by cutting her own throat--all with a sardonic smile on her face. It was traumatic, but Rose thought she could push past such a gruesome event and continue doing her job as a therapist.Wrong.What Rose didn't know was that now she was the target of whatever malevolent being caused her patient to kill herself. From that point on she would slowly devolve into a state of sheer psychosis as she was plagued by something only she, AND WE, could see.""Smile"" was this awesome blend of eerie, chilling, nerve-wracking, and plain scary. There was this pervasive eeriness that hung over the movie like San Francisco fog which I think helped make the jump scares have maximum impact. Look, I've seen HUNDREDS of scary movies and I know all of the jump scare setups, and still this movie got me a few times.So hats off to writer/director Parker Finn, and hats off to Sosie Bacon. Sosie Bacon did a heckuva job as the main character. The cast overall was solid: Jessie T. Usher (A-Train in ""The Boys), Kal Penn (Kumar from ""Harold & Kumar""), Kyle Gallner, and Robin Weigert of note, but this was Sosie's show and she owned it.",smile scariest sh seen probably scariest movie seen since hereditary gotta hand parker finn bag took known formula suped effectively give audience something new squirming edge whole time like rollercoaster rider know drop coming still heart throat happens basic premise oft used one fact thought movie going different version truth dare good smile people serially committing suicide witnessed someone else commit suicide psychologist name rose cotter sosie bacon witnessed girl caitlin stasey commit suiced right front cutting throat sardonic smile face traumatic rose thought could push past gruesome event continue job therapist wrong rose know target whatever malevolent caused patient kill point would slowly devolve state sheer psychosis plagued something could see smile awesome blend eerie chilling nerve wracking plain scary pervasive eeriness hung movie like san francisco fog think helped make jump scare maximum impact look seen hundred scary movie know jump scare setup still movie got time hat writer director parker finn hat sosie bacon sosie bacon heckuva job main character cast overall solid jessie usher train boy kal penn kumar harold kumar kyle gallner robin weigert note sosie show owned
"Given its premise that appears purely silly and gimmicky on the surface, I was shocked that I actually got psychologically wrapped up in the allegorical themes and characterization of Smile.I appreciated that the film cast relatively unknown actors, especially since all of them do a phenomenal job. A LOT is asked of them-to sell trauma and their reaction to it, and they get the job done.First-time writer/director Parker Finn knocked it out of the park with his film's craft. For the most part, his scares rely upon clever placement of HORRIFYING imagery and sound, and a lot of it truly unnerved me. I'll be seeing some of this in my sleep.The sound design really elevates a good chunk of the film, emphasising silence to the point that when a loud noise does come, it's truly shocking.What didn't work for me was the jump scares. It starts off welcomingly restrained, but in the film's second half, the jump-scares start to come out of the woodwork and they gradually lost their effectiveness.But it didn't bother me too much because the imagery stayed so original and truly unsettling.I loved the metaphorical analysis of trauma and it's lingering nature. It's a take on the theme that I haven't seen before and it's largely clever for almost the entire film, even if the film's ending does rely a little too much on forced dialogue to deliver it in a disappointingly clunky way.It's far from perfect, and at times it stumbles, but it's one of the best horror films released this year, and it's intelligent ambition is something to behold.",given premise appears purely silly gimmicky surface shocked actually got psychologically wrapped allegorical theme characterization smile appreciated film cast relatively unknown actor especially since phenomenal job lot asked sell trauma reaction get job done first time writer director parker finn knocked park film craft part scare rely upon clever placement horrifying imagery sound lot truly unnerved seeing sleep sound design really elevates good chunk film emphasising silence point loud noise come truly shocking work jump scare start welcomingly restrained film second half jump scare start come woodwork gradually lost effectiveness bother much imagery stayed original truly unsettling loved metaphorical analysis trauma lingering nature take theme seen largely clever almost entire film even film ending rely little much forced dialogue deliver disappointingly clunky way far perfect time stumble one best horror film released year intelligent ambition something behold
"Within the first 5-10 minutes of this, i felt like i'd seen it before.The victim sees their 'killer' who can take the shape of anyone, normally someone they know. Then when they're about to die, they have an unnervingly broad grin on their faces...Ah yes, 'It Follows', and 'Truth or Dare'.As the film continues into all too familiar territory... Protagonist turns investigator in order to prevent their own death we're then reminded of 'The Ring', or 'Final Destination' to name but two.This just really isn't that good a film. It's another bitterly disappointing affair which sadly borrows far too much from other films, making it completely unoriginal.I've seen a few Horror films this year, and all of them have been utterly hopeless. It's a genre i love, but i'm losing faith in it rapidly. Someone please restore my faith in these films. Give us something original, something genuinely shocking, without being grotesque. Give us something which plays with our head, leaving us unsure of what just happened.",within first minute felt like seen victim see killer take shape anyone normally someone know die unnervingly broad grin face ah yes follows truth dare film continues familiar territory protagonist turn investigator order prevent death reminded ring final destination name two really good film another bitterly disappointing affair sadly borrows far much film making completely unoriginal seen horror film year utterly hopeless genre love losing faith rapidly someone please restore faith film give u something original something genuinely shocking without grotesque give u something play head leaving u unsure happened
"Sosie Bacon (mmm...sausages and bacon!) stars as psychiatric doctor Rose Cotter, who has a bad day at work when one of her patients flips out and commits suicide right in front of her. After this traumatic incident, Rose begins to experience terrifying occurrences that lead her to believe that she is the latest victim of a terrifying curse.Despite this film's jolly sounding title, my wife wasn't smiling when we left the cinema: she said she's probably not going to sleep tonight and she's never going to let me talk her into seeing a horror movie on the big screen again. I guess if you're not as inured to scary movies as I am, then Smile is going to have that effect, the film comprising of a series of jolts, connected by scenes of unsettling eeriness.The whole thing is undeniably well directed and competently acted, but I found the plot a little too generic, the pace a bit too slow, and the scares a tad obvious to be wholly satisfying (plus, the best moment is shown in the trailer). I guess that's the downside of having seen so many horror films -- not much seems very original or scary anymore.My rating: 6/10 (my wife gave it 8/10, so she must have enjoyed herself).",sosie bacon mmm sausage bacon star psychiatric doctor rose cotter bad day work one patient flip commits suicide right front traumatic incident rose begin experience terrifying occurrence lead believe latest victim terrifying curse despite film jolly sounding title wife smiling left cinema said probably going sleep tonight never going let talk seeing horror movie big screen guess inured scary movie smile going effect film comprising series jolt connected scene unsettling eeriness whole thing undeniably well directed competently acted found plot little generic pace bit slow scare tad obvious wholly satisfying plus best moment shown trailer guess downside seen many horror film much seems original scary anymore rating wife gave must enjoyed
"""Because your mind is so inviting..."" So I enjoyed this movie a lot, it was creepy and had a distinct feeling of encroaching and inescapable doom, it was well acted all around and about the only thing that really seriously annoyed me about its structure was that it had to be the most predictable horror movie I've ever seen in my goddamn life!! I predicted the poor cat, I predicted when the situations were real and when they weren't, and I saw every one of those ceaseless jump scares coming a mile away, I'm not usually so on the ball while watching a movie but it was so easy because you could tell because it went quiet and still every time just before something terrible apparition or whatever would pop up and it blurted out the obnoxious cliche noise which bugged me a little too, it's 2022 for crying out loud, why do we still get the big noise jump-scares, it's lame, it doesn't have to be loud to get its point across, it can be so much more effective when it's quieter, you're not really startled by what's happening it's the noise that's doing it! It also had some rather unmistakable similarities to certain recent horror movies about unseen evil entities cursing and tormenting the helpless until there is no escape, but it was okay because the movie was good enough to be it's own thing. Anywho I enjoyed it, it certainly engaged me all the way through and the demon was very evil and horrible and it was so unfair and sad how it got her in the end after all she'd been through and was going to start its cycle of death all over again... It wasn't as satisfying as if it had been truly beaten when she set it on fire and mentally forced it back but I kind of liked how it was a very uncompromising ending, she was ultimately doomed just like the rest. It is a horror movie after all, and sometimes they merit a hopeless ending. I loved the brief glimpse of its true hideous face if you could call it that, very grotesque and twisted, layered mouths inside of mouths reflecting how it gets inside her at the end as well as the malicious smiles. There was something about the story that I found scarier than the monster though, and that was the idea that something only you can see could ruin your life bit by bit and invade your mind and make you look insane until you have nobody and nothing left and are easy prey. I enjoyed this a lot it was good, very satisfyingly and just disturbing enough. I do wish that instead of Lollipop Lollipop oh Lolly Lolly POP at the end they should have played that song from the nineties, ""I Love Your Smile"" you know? Lol but I guess that one might have been a bit too upbeat but so was the one they'd picked! Nice movie, gave me the creeps, lingered in my head a while after I watched it, hope to see more in a sequel!

"I had my doubts before it was released. The first trailer gave us freakish imagery; the second trailer gave us more hints at the plot at large, and it seemed sadly common and unremarkable. That's never a good way to foster excitement for an upcoming release. Dovetailing neatly into the concerns brought forth by the second trailer, the first fourteen minutes of the full film make repeated use of camera angles that would be unorthodox if they weren't so overused in a certain style of major studio genre flick. And while the brevity and conciseness of the opening scene is very promising, serving up haunting ideas and imagery, one is forced to wonder how the concept could possibly be built out into a full two hours. Ultimately, unless one is a total horror fanatic I don't know that it's something so exceptional as to demand viewership, but still I can safely say that I do quite enjoy 'Smile,' and it's well worth checking out. More than that, while the end result kind of fits neatly among its brethren of the last ten to twenty years, I rather think this is maybe a bit smarter and thoughtful than many of its kin, and maybe rises a hair or two above.All the right pieces are here, and let there be no doubts that especially with the benefits of substantial financial backing this is solidly made. Sharp cuts, subdued sound, and pensive, increasingly discordant and unsettling music accentuate the protagonist's scattered mindset while sudden loud sounds and odd occurrences (some discretely pushing the buttons of uncomfortable social situations) increasingly punctuate the length - including jump scares, at least a few of which were so well done they admittedly got to me. Among so many others on hand, my commendations to the effects workshops (Tom Woodruff Jr.!), everyone in the art department, the makeup artists, and not least star Sosie Bacon. The feature really does a fine job of crafting a steadily growing atmosphere of unease, dread, anxiety, and outright terror as events progress, and well made as the picture is all around, these elements in particular are paramount in seeding the same terrible feelings in the viewer. Bacon, specifically, gives a fantastic performance of biting nuance, deteriorating personality, and nervous energy that might actually be the real core of 'Smile,' and on the strength of her show here alone I want to find more of her work.None of this is to count out the hard work of everyone else involved. Following two short films, including this title's predecessor, 'Smile' marks the first full-length feature of filmmaker Parker Finn. Inexperience is no guarantor of innovation nor marker of quality, yet in both his writing and direction he illustrates superb intelligence and mindfulness that helps to make this an outstanding debut in these capacities. His orchestration of shots and scenes, and guidance of his cast, ranges from capable to exquisite, and to my delight I'm happy to say his screenplay might be better yet. Finn starts with and emphasizes earnest, serious real-life notions of trauma, the power of the mind, and how we as a society react to and grapple with questions of mental health, then twists these ideas into a vivid, disconcerting saga of horror. Broken down to the nuts and bolts there is a certain supernatural facet to the plot, and in some of the details of the craftsmanship are echoes of other such fare stretching back a decade or two, or more. Yet I see what Finn was doing, and I think at its heart this is brilliant. Moreover, though some aspects are bent toward unremarkable ends, I can't impugn the contributions in and of themselves. Production design and art direction, Charlie Sarroff's cinematography, and everything else looks and sounds good as it is. Once more, I really do admire Cristobal Tapia de Veer's original music. In addition to Bacon, Caitlin Stasey has little time on-screen but a huge presence; I've seen Kyle Gallner in no few movies at this point, and I have to say I'm actually quite impressed with the acting he turns in here, sturdy and poised. And so it is on down the line for everyone in the cast and crew.I'm pleased that the answer to ""how is this two hours long?"" turned out to be exquisite manifestation of pervasive, gnawing feelings, and writing that's more shrewd than I'd have assumed based on advance marketing. Why, I'd go so far as to say that there's a measure of a psychological element to the narrative, something that necessarily requires a delicate touch to successfully pull off, and I believe Finn does so. Yes, the end result is brought a little low by tidbits that are familiar or ordinary, but even these are well done and feed into the darkness of the whole. From effects practical and special, to stunts and editing; acting, direction, writing, music all the work from behind the scenes - this is, in fact, admirably well done. I was downright cynical about this prior to its release, and while I was generally interested in it, it was nothing I felt a pressing need to watch. Now that I have, I think it's not just entertaining and satisfying, but rewarding, and meaningfully frightening in ways that exceed the average horror flick. It may not be perfect, but at length I'm glad to know that the genre continues to be explored in intriguing, engaging ways by new up and coming filmmakers. As far as I'm concerned, 'Smile' produces one, and it earns my hearty recommendation.",doubt released first trailer gave u freakish imagery second trailer gave u hint plot large seemed sadly common unremarkable never good way foster excitement upcoming release dovetailing neatly concern brought forth second trailer first fourteen minute full film make repeated use camera angle would unorthodox overused certain style major studio genre flick brevity conciseness opening scene promising serving haunting idea imagery one forced wonder concept could possibly built full two hour ultimately unless one total horror fanatic know something exceptional demand viewership still safely say quite enjoy smile well worth checking end result kind fit neatly among brother last ten twenty year rather think maybe bit smarter thoughtful many kin maybe rise hair two right piece let doubt especially benefit substantial financial backing solidly made sharp cut subdued sound pensive increasingly discordant unsettling music accentuate protagonist scattered mindset sudden loud sound odd occurrence discretely pushing button uncomfortable social situation increasingly punctuate length including jump scare least well done admittedly got among many others hand commendation effect workshop tom woodruff jr everyone art department makeup artist least star sosie bacon feature really fine job crafting steadily growing atmosphere unease dread anxiety outright terror event progress well made picture around element particular paramount seeding terrible feeling viewer bacon specifically give fantastic performance biting nuance deteriorating personality nervous energy might actually real core smile strength show alone want find work none count hard work everyone else involved following two short film including title predecessor smile mark first full length feature filmmaker parker finn inexperience guarantor innovation marker quality yet writing direction illustrates superb intelligence mindfulness help make outstanding debut capacity orchestration shot scene guidance cast range capable exquisite delight happy say screenplay might better yet finn start emphasizes earnest serious real life notion trauma power mind society react grapple question mental health twist idea vivid disconcerting saga horror broken nut bolt certain supernatural facet plot detail craftsmanship echo fare stretching back decade two yet see finn think heart brilliant moreover though aspect bent toward unremarkable end impugn contribution production design art direction charlie sarroff cinematography everything else look sound good really admire cristobal tapia de veer original music addition bacon caitlin stasey little time screen huge presence seen kyle gallner movie point say actually quite impressed acting turn sturdy poised line everyone cast crew pleased answer two hour long turned exquisite manifestation pervasive gnawing feeling writing shrewd assumed based advance marketing go far say measure psychological element narrative something necessarily requires delicate touch successfully pull believe finn yes end result brought little low tidbit familiar ordinary even well done feed darkness whole effect practical special stunt editing acting direction writing music work behind scene fact admirably well done downright cynical prior release generally interested nothing felt pressing need watch think entertaining satisfying rewarding meaningfully frightening way exceed average horror flick may perfect length glad know genre continues explored intriguing engaging way new coming filmmaker far concerned smile produce one earns hearty recommendation
"Doctor Rose Cotter watches in horror as a patient commits a horrifying act, her life changes dramatically after it.For me, this felt like a mix of It Follows and Truth or Dare, I was trying to think what the smiling element reminded me of, and it was the latter, although the theme was put to much better use here.Plenty of scares and thrills, this was definitely the best horror I've seen in quite a while, very well produced, with some great acting, I may not have liked the main character, but Sosie Bacon was excellent.Not sure what people will make of the ending, it'll be divisive, I thought it was ok, for me, the early horror angles were terrific.The only real detractor for me, I found it very hard to like central character Rose, it was very hard to empathise with her, as she was generally unpleasant, as was her husband.They have definitely left the door open for a second movie, perhaps with Joel as the central character, you can never have too much Kyle Gallner.Blu ray ordered.8/10.",doctor rose cotter watch horror patient commits horrifying act life change dramatically felt like mix follows truth dare trying think smiling element reminded latter although theme put much better use plenty scare thrill definitely best horror seen quite well produced great acting may liked main character sosie bacon excellent sure people make ending divisive thought ok early horror angle terrific real detractor found hard like central character rose hard empathise generally unpleasant husband definitely left door open second movie perhaps joel central character never much kyle gallner blu ray ordered
"I was debating between a 7 and 8 and probably would give Smile a 7.5 . . . I just can't quite rate it an 8 so in this case I rounded down.The characters (starting with the therapist and her fiancee) were probably the most annoying part of the film for me. Even the therapists' department director (or whatever he was) came across a little too stereotypical. The biggest weakness with the characters as they were written was their inability to communicate well (or almost at all). Had the therapist started communicating to her fiancee the supernatural aspects of what she was experiencing in thought-through snippets rather than in garbled hysterics, things could have been managed far more effectively from the outset. Too many times I see acting out stereotypes rather than realistic roles/characters which unfortunately happened in Smile. Too (as others have mentioned), a basic understanding of first aid would have helped many of the characters starting with the therapist (which would be expected of them in their vocations).To round out the flaws, there was some repetitiveness in the scenes and I'm not sure the creepy smile was always that terrifying;
I suppose it was unique enough so I'll give it a pass.On the positive and to why I gave Smile an above average score.First, the filming/cinematography was excellent.Next, the directing didn't hold back from goryness (something generic horror offerings ""pump the brakes on"").And there was actually a creature/monster (2 even), which I give full props to (despite the difficulty in pulling off the feat with perfection). Real effects are always appreciated amongst us horror buffs, and Smile had a decent mix, mostly real even.Finally, there were some imaginative, effective jump scares (along with a few that were predictable). Overall there were enough fear-inducing moments (combined with the aforementioned positives) to give this film a thumbs up.",debating probably would give smile quite rate case rounded character starting therapist fiancee probably annoying part film even therapist department director whatever came across little stereotypical biggest weakness character written inability communicate well almost therapist started communicating fiancee supernatural aspect experiencing thought snippet rather garbled hysteric thing could managed far effectively outset many time see acting stereotype rather realistic role character unfortunately happened smile others mentioned basic understanding first aid would helped many character starting therapist would expected vocation round flaw repetitiveness scene sure creepy smile always terrifying suppose unique enough give pas positive gave smile average score first filming cinematography excellent next directing hold back goryness something generic horror offering pump brake actually creature monster even give full prop despite difficulty pulling feat perfection real effect always appreciated amongst u horror buff smile decent mix mostly real even finally imaginative effective jump scare along predictable overall enough fear inducing moment combined aforementioned positive give film thumb

"Smile (2022) tells a story of a mysterious curse that makes people Smile to their death. Its unique but not really original in hindsight ( think The Ring with its patterned curses). Interestingly, it melds issues that not necessarily Horror by nature i.e. Mental Health, Trauma and the Health Care system AND makes a serviceable narrative out of it.But here's the thing, it disappoints heavily with how the moving gears went. The choice to make the side characters more annoying was detrimental to it feeling natural. They were trying really hard to really make the lead and that other guy likeable that it comes off very corny and ham-fisted. I telegraphed the ending too. So predictability is on the higher point.Overall, this is very by the books Horror trying to get their franchise going.

"""Smile"" follows Rose Cotter, a psychiatrist who encounters a disturbed patient claiming to be cursed by a shapeshifting entity who bears a sinister smile. Soon after this traumatic encounter (which ends grimly), Rose finds herself plagued by the same, much to the confusion and horror of those around her.I went into this film fully expecting a popcorn-caliber horror movie, and that it was--however, it was not a very good one. Despite a fairly strong (and creepy) opening sequence, I found ""Smile"" to be middling at best, and excruciatingly trite at its worst. The film takes a familiar concept (""The Ring"" and ""It Follows"" are obvious major influences) but unfortunately does not do much of anything interesting with it. The ""curse"" bestowed on the lead character takes over her life and, as is the case with other films in this vein, leads her down a nightmarish path and a host of ""is this all in her head?"" scenarios. The plot devices used here have been done to death, which isn't always a bad thing, but the film overall lacked the tension necessary to make a story like this compelling.A large part of what makes ""Smile"" ineffective rests in its rote and uninspired dialogue. Save the lead, the characters here are one-dimensional to a fault, and almost the entire supporting cast (aside from Sosie Bacon and Kyle Gallner, who actually offer sturdy performances) are abysmal--utterly stiff and unconvincing, which only further detracts from the lack of threat that should be at the center of the screenplay. The theme of the impact of grief and trauma is woven into the plot, which had the potential to be meaningful, but the overall execution fails this theme.All that being said, the film is not totally without merit. The cinematography is stylish, and there is a haunting score that rises and falls throughout, adding to the ambiance. As I noted before, Sosie Bacon gives a good (albeit not flawless) performance as the lead, which gains more vitality as the film the goes on. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the film, which culminates in an overwrought, silly finale replete with some audacious visual effects.While it offers a few effective sequences, ""Smile"" is ultimately banal. More than anything else, its trite dialogue and lackluster performances drain the film of its creative potential. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about it though is that, even as a popcorn movie, it is inefficacious on nearly every level. 4/10.",smile follows rose cotter psychiatrist encounter disturbed patient claiming cursed shapeshifting entity bear sinister smile soon traumatic encounter end grimly rose find plagued much confusion horror around went film fully expecting popcorn caliber horror movie however good one despite fairly strong creepy opening sequence found smile middling best excruciatingly trite worst film take familiar concept ring follows obvious major influence unfortunately much anything interesting curse bestowed lead character take life case film vein lead nightmarish path host head scenario plot device used done death always bad thing film overall lacked tension necessary make story like compelling large part make smile ineffective rest rote uninspired dialogue save lead character one dimensional fault almost entire supporting cast aside sosie bacon kyle gallner actually offer sturdy performance abysmal utterly stiff unconvincing detracts lack threat center screenplay theme impact grief trauma woven plot potential meaningful overall execution fails theme said film totally without merit cinematography stylish haunting score rise fall throughout adding ambiance noted sosie bacon give good albeit flawless performance lead gain vitality film go unfortunately enough save film culminates overwrought silly finale replete audacious visual effect offer effective sequence smile ultimately banal anything else trite dialogue lackluster performance drain film creative potential perhaps disappointing thing though even popcorn movie inefficacious nearly every level
"Rose (Rosie Bacon) is a psychiatrist who has a new patient that cuts her own throat in front of her whilst staring at Rose with a vast, demonic smile on her face. Recovering from her ordeal Rose starts seeing things and starts to realise that a pattern of people committing suicide whilst smiling in the same scary way exists.Genuinely unnerving and often scary horror thriller with a fine central performance from Bacon. The film may follow a somewhat predictable route of her going nuts, investigating what's at the root of everything and then facing off against whatever it is, but it's very well made and intriguing as well as frightening, including one or two good jump scares. Not sure I was 100% sold on the ending which was a bit messy, but that's a minor quibble.

"Firstly, if you're rating this 10/10 then you need to delete your account.This was one of the most tediously written films I've ever seen. Constant jump scares that become a chore, characters acting in the most bizarre fashion, just so the story can progress and a 30 minute short film, stretched out over 2 hours.Every single character makes the most frustrating decisions, because the writers clearly needed to connect the dots. This is my biggest frustration with this film and it goes on in almost every single scene from the first second of the movie. It becomes unbearable towards the end.Some ok performances do very little to save this mess. You'll love this if you hate your braincells or if you think mildly creepy faces make for a terrifying experience.",firstly rating need delete account one tediously written film ever seen constant jump scare become chore character acting bizarre fashion story progress minute short film stretched hour every single character make frustrating decision writer clearly needed connect dot biggest frustration film go almost every single scene first second movie becomes unbearable towards end ok performance little save mess love hate braincells think mildly creepy face make terrifying experience
"I used to be a huge fan of horror movies but lately haven't found any I really loved. They're a bit too far on the cheesy side, but this one was a nice surprise. A lot of jump scares yes, but better than most. I didn't always see them coming so that was cool. I liked the premise and I found myself rooting for Cotter. I wanted her to break the cycle. The plot with her mother wasn't one I guessed ahead of time either. I found myself trying to figure out which parts were real after a bit.

"""Smile"" is a pretty enjoyable time at the movies with the right crowd. Sosie Bacon gives a solid performance and this performance makes the film enjoyable. The film kind of drags from the Mid Point to the end of Act II, but the beginning and climax are pretty great. The film's effects work of car driving shots and some stabbings are not that great. But other effects are pretty good, even unintentionally funny at times. Having watched Barbarian recently (10/10), Smile could have used some of that ""humor"" because any humor in smile is unintentional, whereas Barbarian is very surgical. Smile, from a concept level, is interesting following in the footsteps of The Ring and It Follows, but Smile doesn't check off all the boxes to get to a 10/10. The music, acting, and sometimes direction is great. The effects work really drops the ball at times. However, this is a fun time at the movies for sure.",smile pretty enjoyable time movie right crowd sosie bacon give solid performance performance make film enjoyable film kind drag mid point end act ii beginning climax pretty great film effect work car driving shot stabbings great effect pretty good even unintentionally funny time watched barbarian recently smile could used humor humor smile unintentional whereas barbarian surgical smile concept level interesting following footstep ring follows smile check box get music acting sometimes direction great effect work really drop ball time however fun time movie sure
"Smile is quite engaging and partially scary horror flick embedded with plenty of jump scares,traumatic scenes and conversations. Though the horror part was completely relied on the jump scares. The director has more focused on traumatic incidents ensuring the disturbing intensity to the audience throughout the film,Though it feels a bit dragged down the trauma has successfully ensured a disturbing experience but the horror part could have sdealed better,there are moments that some jump scares,violent Visuals and an extended smile-devil scenes that improvises viewers experience in horror aspect yet it didn't compell so hard. Rosy as a victim could have faced a few more tragedies rather than spending the most of the screen time on the the discovery of the curse. As the plot is quite thin and straight forward there's nothing so exciting to watch as far as the plot is concerned but the director has somehow ensured the disturbing parts to be hindered around the middle. But yet lack of unexpected plot Twists is the major drawback in the film. The climax is well made but it's quite predictable doesn't excited much except the smiling devil doing some gymnastics over rose and her old house. All over Smile is worth for getting you on a disturbing mood and ensuring the horror part in most of it's runtime but still the drama part and the sad conversations are so extensive and could have been cut short replacing them with some creepy moments.",smile quite engaging partially scary horror flick embedded plenty jump scare traumatic scene conversation though horror part completely relied jump scare director focused traumatic incident ensuring disturbing intensity audience throughout film though feel bit dragged trauma successfully ensured disturbing experience horror part could sdealed better moment jump scare violent visuals extended smile devil scene improvises viewer experience horror aspect yet compell hard rosy victim could faced tragedy rather spending screen time discovery curse plot quite thin straight forward nothing exciting watch far plot concerned director somehow ensured disturbing part hindered around middle yet lack unexpected plot twist major drawback film climax well made quite predictable excited much except smiling devil gymnastics rose old house smile worth getting disturbing mood ensuring horror part runtime still drama part sad conversation extensive could cut short replacing creepy moment
"When Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) meets with a client who suddenly commits suicide in her office, she begins to see spectres, each of whom give her an unsettling 'Smile'. After trying to convince her boyfriend Trevor (Jessie T. Usher) that she isn't crazy, Rose sets out to try to end the curse of the smiling visions.Solid script and flow. The film feels a lot like 'It Follows' (2014), but executed in a much better way.

"The dirty little secret about horror movies . . . And I say this as a connosieur . . . Is that the vast majority of them really, really suck.Notwithstanding the unlimited themes and plots that human ingenuity can come up with, putting together the actual script and film is an art. Now, I will not sit here and say that ""Smile"" is aligned for an oscar. Of course, the Horror genre rarely gets the nod anyways. But, this directorial debut by Parker Finn certainly should be praised and respected.The movie follows a talented young psychiatrist - Rose Cotter - who treats a patient (PHd candidate Laura Weaver) for trauma associated with eyewitnessing her professor's horrific suicide. As Rose Cotter delves further into Laura's case (much further due to a ""glitch"" in Laura's improvement), she herself battles trauma of her own. A trauma that, shall we say, is kind of contagious ... and malevolent.This movie shares base DNA with films like ""The Grudge"" and even classics like ""Poltergeist"".

"Everything about this film is terrible, from the acting to the dialogue, to the camera work, to the music. It is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen.This film is essentially a rip-off if It Follows, except instead of the 'curse' being passed on by sex, it's by someone dying with a witness. Because that's so much more entertaining.The main actress is the pinnacle of what makes this movie so irritating. She herself is so completely annoying in every factor. She is unlikable, entitled, screechy and melodramatic.There are many parts of the film which are clearly supposed to be scary or unnerving, which just come across as hilarious, like when she tried to kill the crazy guy, which is the only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema.The music is incredibly irritating, particularly the random moments of pizzicato, and other assorted random noises, which just seem pointless.There are also a great deal of just gratuitous swear words, and yeah, I get it's an 18, and I have no problem hearing these words or anything, but it just takes the edge of it and makes it irritating to listen to, especially when they're delivered the same exact way every single time.There are also several annoying and unnecessary camera angles/shots. Such as the one where the camera spins upside down, which true, the first time looked quite good, but then it did it again. And again. And now I've got vertigo. There are also a couple of shots of things which are just gross, like a close up shot of the girl's face, or some pet food, or her eating disgustingly. I don't wanna see that. It's minging.The jumpscares, of which there are an unnecessary amount, are generic, fairly badly done and didn't make me jump once, despite the sound mixing being ungodly loud for them.In conclusion, this is absolutely nothing new and yet another 'whiny woman with past trauma thinks everyone needs to listen to her or they're in the wrong' movie.",everything film terrible acting dialogue camera work music one worst horror film ever seen film essentially rip follows except instead curse passed sex someone dying witness much entertaining main actress pinnacle make movie irritating completely annoying every factor unlikable entitled screechy melodramatic many part film clearly supposed scary unnerving come across hilarious like tried kill crazy guy reason walk cinema music incredibly irritating particularly random moment pizzicato assorted random noise seem pointless also great deal gratuitous swear word yeah get problem hearing word anything take edge make irritating listen especially delivered exact way every single time also several annoying unnecessary camera angle shot one camera spin upside true first time looked quite good got vertigo also couple shot thing gross like close shot girl face pet food eating disgustingly wanna see minging jumpscares unnecessary amount generic fairly badly done make jump despite sound mixing ungodly loud conclusion absolutely nothing new yet another whiny woman past trauma think everyone need listen wrong movie
"Smile = 9/10Positive:-The protagonist Rose is not particularly deep, but she conveys the fear and desperation about the curse extremely well. She also gets a very exciting backstory that is well woven into the story.-The staging is high quality and horror scenes are edited effectively. Violence and masks also look good.-The plot is simple but clever and is a mixture of horror/crime and psychological thriller.-The constant paranoia and fear are conveyed perfectly. The feeling that no one believes you and the feeling of losing more and more control over what is happening is scary.-The scary moments are extremely scary and exciting. No jump scare is cheap, they are all well constructed and then end in really extreme jump scares that stay in your head and don't just serve to scare you for a short time.-The finale plays well with Rose's childhood and the fear of her mother, which is embodied in the monster. Fittingly, the film doesn't have a happy ending but continues the cycle of the monster.Negative:-The film is nothing new and not particularly unique. He just manages to cleverly combine a lot of horror elements, which is a bit lame in some scenes.Conclusion: One of the scariest films of recent years. He slowly builds a myth around a creature and our protagonist cleverly solves the case and is chased through some eerie horror moments.

"When we saw this was on Paramount+ we couldn't wait to see it. It started off super strong, intense and interesting, then as the movie went on I found my husband grabbing his lap top, me browsing on my phone and our son started getting less interested.With the previews and hype they gave this movie we were expecting to be blown away scared, instead we ended up bored (kind of like Barbarian).The ending wasn't terrible, but it was very similar to several other horror movies we've all seen. I ended up falling asleep on the couch shortly before that.It is an interesting movie, but they could have done so much more and so much better.....it fell super short in my opinion and was disappointing.",saw paramount wait see started super strong intense interesting movie went found husband grabbing lap top browsing phone son started getting le interested preview hype gave movie expecting blown away scared instead ended bored kind like barbarian ending terrible similar several horror movie seen ended falling asleep couch shortly interesting movie could done much much better fell super short opinion disappointing

"The plot was basically a mixture of Lights Out and It Follows, two fantastic horrors. SO.. the actual plot of this movie owes a lot to the tropes within the genre
It shouldn't work, there's not much fleshed development behind ""the why"" of the monster so this movies spends a while figuring out ""the how."" It was a bit tedious to discover what was happening in terms of the curse, the way it jumps from person to person. The typical ""main character is not believed because she's a hysterical woman"" plot device. I mean, that's been going on since Rosemary's Baby, but that plot was much more developed and there was reasoning behind it.There's a wonderful performance from Sosie Bacon at the helm. You really root for her character. But the fianc√© is a cliche, you wonder why they're even together.Overall, what makes this movie are the jump scares. They are effective and unpredictable. The cinematography is also very moody and atmospheric.You will be frightened.

"Watched this last night not knowing what to expect. But as soon as the first visual victim emerged with that creepy smile I knew it was worth watching. As many have stated it's nearest relative is It Follows, which is a horror that stood out in a good way (for me at least). Smile though was more creepy and simpler as a concept, which in my opinion made it all the more unsettling. I found the smiling women to be more scary than the men. Especially the protagonist's therapist about half way through.The only thing I could have a gripe about with this film is... it's predictableness. The ending was quite unimaginative for sure, but was there really any other way it could end that would satisfy horror fans? Not really no. It's just not that kind of film. All in all I enjoyed this film. Out of place smiling is creepy as a concept. It's why clowns get a bad rep after all. I actually think it could be the best horror I've seen this year. It's was never gonna be the best horror I've ever seen though. I will recommend it to like minded people I know.",watched last night knowing expect soon first visual victim emerged creepy smile knew worth watching many stated nearest relative follows horror stood good way least smile though creepy simpler concept opinion made unsettling found smiling woman scary men especially protagonist therapist half way thing could gripe film predictableness ending quite unimaginative sure really way could end would satisfy horror fan really kind film enjoyed film place smiling creepy concept clown get bad rep actually think could best horror seen year never gonna best horror ever seen though recommend like minded people know

"No pun intended - the trailer might have given away quite a lot, but there is still a lot in this to be discovered. And to make you turn that frown upside down - or whatever it is called. Although if that happens ... I mean credit where credit is due: making something scary that is supposed to be a good thing into a ... well evil and bad thing? Nicely done.Also quite interesting to see the lead actress at a a late night show (her first ever as they said) - maybe that is why she was all over the place and I reckon you could say super excited. If you compare that with how she acts in the movie - well there are worlds in between. So kudos, even if it is ""only"" a horror movie! Great performance by her and the other. Also she is the daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick - if that means anything to you.That all aside, the effects are good and the movie has some very good shock moments. Not too many but they are really well placed and enough to get you going ... there are also some really nasty and bloody/violent images ... not for the faint of hearted then ... twists work too. I for one thought there would something happening with a kid - this might have been a side story that either was explored and not taken or a red hering.

"SMILE (2022) is a rarity of a modern film that was somewhat hyped, looked good in the trailers, AND is actually an excellent movie. An authentic slow burn horror exercise, Smile is rarely slow or boring due to a genuinely scary and creepy horror vibe and mostly strong writing and acting. The smashing opening pre-title scene set the tone for the entire film, a scene which features the 2 actresses who delivered the best performances of the movie, one of which was thankfully the lead who we follow on this journey. In the opener, our heroine Dr. Rose Cotter (superbly played by Sosie Bacon from 13 Reasons Why), a psychiatrist who treats clinically depressed and suicidal patients, takes a walk in patient named Laura (brilliant performance by Caitlin Stasey, who also starred in the short film that this feature is based on). Shrieking and screaming in horror, Laura has to be dragged in by a group of orderlies. After having calmed down and put in a therapy room, Laura relays her tale to Rose. Apparently, a few days earlier, Laura witnessed her college professor kill himself and as a result she claims to be hallucinating people creepily smiling at her, including visions of deceased relatives. Then Laura sees something behind Rose and her body contorts in shock as a frozen-in-fear Rose watches the now smiling Laura slash her own throat. This opening scene alone could be called the best of the film as Stasey and Bacon crushed it. The scene also projects the filming style throughout the movie of fourth-wall breaking closeups and constantly moving camera shots and angles. The rest of the film follows Rose as she starts seeing creepy smiling people and loses her grip on reality. Smile works both as a horror piece as well as an insightful commentary on mental illness and the effects of trauma. Even though it's a supernatural force causing these characters to kill themselves, it's not hard to imagine that visibly seeing someone commit suicide right in front of them would scar them mentally and emotionally for the rest of their lives. Also, as a child Rose witnessed her mother commit suicide, so the film's premise of her witnessing another suicide as an adult adds another layer to her character's trauma, as well as the fact that she became a psychiatrist to help people as a coping mechanism and to honor her mother.Bacon is exceptional in the lead role delivering an incredibly persuasive performance from start to finish. Not once did I feel cheated by her acting. She totally carries this movie and this is probably my favorite lead performance of a horror film of like the last decade. Having a sympathetic, likable, and rootable protagonist throughout ANY film seems to be a chore for modern Hollywood and especially in a horror movie where the ""rules"" appear to be characters have to do dumb things to move the plot along, but this movie pulls it off. While she was playing a character going through immense emotional trauma, Bacon played the role close to the vest and never overacted or chewed scenery. Bacon was so good that I'm surprised she didn't get any kind of award recognition for this performance, then again overacting is actually what wins awards much of the time. Outside of Bacon, there were varying levels of acting. As mentioned, Stasey was equally excellent to Bacon in the opening scene, but then her character was gone after the pre-title opening scene, leaving it to Bacon to do all the heavy lifting the rest of the way. In terms of the supporting cast, the best acting was from veteran actors Kyle Gallner (as Rose's cop ex-boyfriend helping her unravel the mystery), Robin Wiegert (as Rose's psychiatrist), Rob Morgan (as a mental patient that Rose visited for information on the suicide chain), Judy Reyes (as the late professor's grieving widow that Rose visited), and Jack Sochet (as Carl, one of Rose's patients). Gallner, Wiegert, Morgan, Reyes, and Sochet really hit all the right notes in their limited screen time. This was significant enough good acting to sustain the film's high quality. But the rest of the minor cast was a mixed bag and their limited screen time was welcome. Kal Penn was just OK in a thankless role of the hospital administrator, reduced to being only a cliche 1-dimensional, clueless trope boss character. Gillian Zinser (as Rose's annoying sister) and Nick Arapaglou (as Rose's even more annoying brother-in-law) are at the next lower rung. It's not so much that their acting is bad as that they are written as typical cringe, egocentric Gen Z yuppies, who are supposed to be funny, but not even close. The worst performance was easily delivered by Jessie T. Usher (as Rose's fiance Trevor), who was in enough scenes to drag the movie's rating down with his bad acting. Thankfully, the writers opted to make the fiance oblivious and disinterested, which enabled them to shift focus on the relationship between Rose and the cop, so that Bacon actually had a competent actor in Gallner to play off of the last half of the movie.Smile pretty much plays everything straight with a refreshingly uncomplicated and linear plot. Thus, the movie relies heavily on atmosphere, cinematography, dialogue, and acting, especially by the convincing lead. In particular, I really liked how normal and natural most of the dialogue sounded. Characters acted and reacted the way one would expect in such an extraordinary plot. EVERY character thought Rose's demon possession story was absurd and that she was actually having a mental breakdown and losing her grip on reality, which is exactly the way that it should be. And Rose herself slowly only came to grips with the absurdity of her situation as she delved deeper into her search for answers. One could tell through Bacon's believable acting that even Rose had a difficult time accepting her fate, which again is very believable. I strongly dislike it when characters behave unrealistically just to move the plot along. Many horror movies will have their main characters or some random supporting character ""expert"" force-feed exposition to the viewer and over-explain things to the point where suspension of disbelief becomes impossible. But Smile thankfully opted to treat the audience with respect and not hand-hold the entire film. Modern films could learn a lesson from Smile and make characters and their actions to be relatable and believable instead of trying so hard to make them unrealistically perfect. Even the setting feels less generic than most modern movies, which I atrribute mostly to the excellent cinematography and camera work.

"Smile is a perfectly fine horror film, but perhaps should have been better given the premise, which was very promising.To the films credit, there are some decent scares (although a little too reliant on jump scares for me), and the acting is solid, with a great lead performance from Sosie Bacon.However I found the plot to be a bit too tired. It just seemed entirely predictable and a tad cliche, and could have gone in a much more interesting direction I feel. Not to mention the fact that the trailer really does give away too much and spoils a few of the films best moments which weaken their impact when you actually watch the film.Smile joins a long list of horror films which aren't particularly scary, but which aren't bad either. It has some good concepts and good moments but fails to fully capitalise on them, resulting in an entertaining but largely forgettable film.",smile perfectly fine horror film perhaps better given premise promising film credit decent scare although little reliant jump scare acting solid great lead performance sosie bacon however found plot bit tired seemed entirely predictable tad cliche could gone much interesting direction feel mention fact trailer really give away much spoil film best moment weaken impact actually watch film smile join long list horror film particularly scary bad either good concept good moment fails fully capitalise resulting entertaining largely forgettable film
"I bring up Blumhouse even though this wasn't from that production company, but it feels like it should be in some way. We seem to keep getting these teeny type cheap horror films that are literally cheap to make but still get the tik tok generation to flock to them. This is just more of the same mediocrity with laughably bad subject matter. Such a lazy concept and it shows with the overall product. A shame to see the horror scene devolve this badly. I can't help but think this genre will be dead no pun intended within a decade.

Usher-The Boys_tv, Shaft_2019; Kyle Gallner-Scream_2022, Smallville_tv and Kal Penn-Designated Survivor_tv, House_tv.This is a horror film about a psychiatrist that needs a good psychiatrist. When she was 10 years old, Sosie's mother committed suicide-that's why Sosie became a doctor in the first place, to help people. Sosie sees a woman commit suicide right in front of her during a session-which triggers old memories of her mother. Before she dies, the woman says several cryptic things that get Sosie doing some research and she finds out that there have been other cases of similarity. 20 in fact. Jessie is Sosie's boyfriend and Kal is her boss at the hospital and neither believe her story-they think she might just need a rest from working too much. Sosie starts having dreams and visions of bad things happening, both to herself and to other people and thinks that she may be cursed from the patient she saw die.

"Going into Smile was relatively easy, as I am pretty difficult to scare. However, I had taken some Delta 8 gummies prior to me entering the theater, which, due to me being autistic, made my heightened senses even higher. I truly believe that the gummies made me think this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. The sound design is very creative, so seeing this in theaters is a must, but the smiling in the movie is extremely creepy. The acting in this film is definitely a huge highlight. I didn't expect the acting to be anywhere near the caliber it was, since most horror films I have seen in recent times didn't really focus on acting. But Sosie Bacon was amazing in her role as Dr. Rose Cotter, and I don't think anybody could've pulled off that role in a way that would match her performance. As Rose slowly loses her mind to this curse, you feel as if you're dragged along with her. Despite the almost 2 hour runtime, the movie genuinely feels like an anxiety/panic attack that gets worse as the movie progressed. The score is also amazing. This year has blessed us when it comes to musical score in cinema, and Smile is another film I can add to my ""Amazing Movie Scores"" list. Mix that with the intricate sound design, and you pretty much have your standard horror film, but this one is genuinely terrifying and had me cowering in my seat like a freaking baby. Sitting in the third row of seats almost right in front of the screen definitely did not help. While I will most likely be seeing the film again due to me having the reaction I did, I will definitely find out if this movie is genuinely scary or if I was just tripping. Either way, Smile was fantastic and messed with my head a little. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters.",going smile relatively easy pretty difficult scare however taken delta gummies prior entering theater due autistic made heightened sens even higher truly believe gummies made think scariest movie ever seen sound design creative seeing theater must smiling movie extremely creepy acting film definitely huge highlight expect acting anywhere near caliber since horror film seen recent time really focus acting sosie bacon amazing role dr rose cotter think anybody could pulled role way would match performance rose slowly loses mind curse feel dragged along despite almost hour runtime movie genuinely feel like anxiety panic attack get worse movie progressed score also amazing year blessed u come musical score cinema smile another film add amazing movie score list mix intricate sound design pretty much standard horror film one genuinely terrifying cowering seat like freaking baby sitting third row seat almost right front screen definitely help likely seeing film due reaction definitely find movie genuinely scary tripping either way smile fantastic messed head little definitely worth seeing theater
"I typically don't care for horror flicks as they have seriously gotten cheesier over the years and are usually full of cheap scares. Even higher budget ones just don't do anything for me and usually fall flat so I will just scroll on, however Smile intrigued me so I put it on my radar. No one in the family wanted to see it with me so when it came on for free during a trial, I jumped on it. So glad I did as it kept me on edge during the whole thing. It's hair raising creepiness is originally orchestrated. I don't understand the reviews that say it's not ""original"" as I have not seen or maybe missed concepts like this one. When ""trauma"" is the evil, sadly most people can relate. What goes on in our own head and how we deal with it, is magnified in this movie and that's what elevates the scare factor. It's well done frame to frame. Would recommend for an entertaining scary time.",typically care horror flick seriously gotten cheesier year usually full cheap scare even higher budget one anything usually fall flat scroll however smile intrigued put radar one family wanted see came free trial jumped glad kept edge whole thing hair raising creepiness originally orchestrated understand review say original seen maybe missed concept like one trauma evil sadly people relate go head deal magnified movie elevates scare factor well done frame frame would recommend entertaining scary time
"""Smile"" rates among the best horror films to come out in the past few years. While there are moments of extreme violence and blood, they are rare. This film is terrifying because it gets in your head and takes the ordinary, a smile, and transforms it into ""hide your eyes"" creepiness that might just keep you up at night. The acting is superb and the premise of the film, seemingly normal people who, after witnessing a traumatic death, suddenly appear to lose their minds to the shock and dismay of friends, family, colleagues and behavioral therapists. After about 4 days of seeming insanity, these people, who have been trying to get others to believe their unbelievable stories, ultimately kill themselves in front of a concerned person with the creepy smile on their face. The only negative of this skin-crawling thriller is the weak ending, which I will not reveal because the film is good enough to see regardless of that singular flaw.",smile rate among best horror film come past year moment extreme violence blood rare film terrifying get head take ordinary smile transforms hide eye creepiness might keep night acting superb premise film seemingly normal people witnessing traumatic death suddenly appear lose mind shock dismay friend family colleague behavioral therapist day seeming insanity people trying get others believe unbelievable story ultimately kill front concerned person creepy smile face negative skin crawling thriller weak ending reveal film good enough see regardless singular flaw
"I have low expectations getting into this, chalking it off as just another cheesy gore of a film. But a few minutes in you get sucked into those impressive camera angles and shots: upside down, wide shots, skewed angles, reflections on tables. That's when you sit back and take it in and be open to what this movie has in store for you. And it's actually really good. The soundtrack is outstanding and each background music choice and timing appropriately complements whatever suspenseful or horrific scene is happening. I am not familiar with the lead Sosie Bacon, who apparently is the daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick. At first I think what an odd choice of a lead actress as she isn't particularly stunning and the first scenes show her as just a run-of-the-mill doctor. But as her character devolves into madness, she becomes the perfect choice. Add her to the list of scream queens with actual acting chops. If you're looking to feel both uneasy and excited at the same time, this satisfying movie would do it for you.",low expectation getting chalking another cheesy gore film minute get sucked impressive camera angle shot upside wide shot skewed angle reflection table sit back take open movie store actually really good soundtrack outstanding background music choice timing appropriately complement whatever suspenseful horrific scene happening familiar lead sosie bacon apparently daughter kevin bacon kyra sedgwick first think odd choice lead actress particularly stunning first scene show run mill doctor character devolves madness becomes perfect choice add list scream queen actual acting chop looking feel uneasy excited time satisfying movie would
Movie had my interest every minute all the way from beginning to end. That's not an easy thing to do. It had me totally involved and interested in the whole mental health disease aspect of the whole thing and then sprinkle a little bit of this demonic paranormal and very entertaining aspect all three of the movie. Put those two together and you have a very engrossing movie that actually felt like it went quick. I actually could have washed another 30 minutes.

"It Follows fans will be absolutely pleased. The likeness between the two films is indisputable. This film is insanely spooky, both in the general creepiness aspect and its ability to setup the atmosphere for jump-scares and pull them off effortlessly. I had to mute the TV or look away from the screen at times, the buildup was too good/too intense.

"Smile: The idea of a chain curse, spread from person to person is a well worn trope, it's how Smile approaches the idea makes it a well worth watching film. Rose (Sosie Bacon) is a doctor in an Emergency Psychiatric Unit, working long hours, you can see how tired she is. She assesses a patient, Laura (Cautlin Stasey), who is seeing entities, suddenly Laura starts smiling and cuts her own throat. Rose discovers that Laura had also witnessed a suicide only days before. This sets her off on a quest for patient zero or someone who has broken the chain. With the help of her ex, Joel (Kyle Gallner) who is a detective. The chain of smiling suicides stretches way back. There are some good jump scares in Smile, a lot of the horror scenes take place in her reveries where she sees terrible visions. Flashbacks to her youth and her mentally troubled mother in a distorted form also happen in these day-nightmares. There is also the psychological horror of Rose's disintegrating personality, she has no insight into her behaviour or how it is perceived by others. Smile's 115 minute running time is fully justified as the narrative unfolds. Written and Directed by Parker Finn (in his feature directorial debut), based on his 2020 short film Laura Hasn't Slept. 8.5/10.",smile idea chain curse spread person person well worn trope smile approach idea make well worth watching film rose sosie bacon doctor emergency psychiatric unit working long hour see tired ass patient laura cautlin stasey seeing entity suddenly laura start smiling cut throat rose discovers laura also witnessed suicide day set quest patient zero someone broken chain help ex joel kyle gallner detective chain smiling suicide stretch way back good jump scare smile lot horror scene take place revery see terrible vision flashback youth mentally troubled mother distorted form also happen day nightmare also psychological horror rose disintegrating personality insight behaviour perceived others smile minute running time fully justified narrative unfolds written directed parker finn feature directorial debut based short film laura slept
"Smile is a horror film directed by Parker Finn in his feature directorial debut. For someone's directorial debut, this is very impressive.There are deeply unsettling visuals and proper tension. The movie is reliant on jump scare and it can get tedious. However, there is a fair amount of jump scare with good build-up and payoff which did scare me. I also love the sound design in this film. The director uses it effectively to create a creepy feeling. The first 2 acts of the film are well done. We see our main character Rose (Sosie Bacon) slowly descend into madness as the 'curse' becomes more prominent. On that note, Sosie Bacon is phenomenal as the main lead. She gives a convincing performance of someone who is losing their mind.Nevertheless, this film falls into a lot of the generic tropes of a horror movie. Its plot isn't original, you've seen it in films like It Follows and The Ring. It has a lot of the same beat-for-beat elements you've seen a dozen times. Even the ending is something you have seen in other horror movies. The main character also says and does incredibly stupid things. There are also moments in this film that are unintentionally funny and silly but are meant to be serious moments.Overall, it is a well-made horror film, especially for a director's first film. Still, it never really goes beyond a generic horror movie. If you want something different in the horror genre then this is not it. I still look forward to what Parker Finn does next though because he is very promising!",smile horror film directed parker finn feature directorial debut someone directorial debut impressive deeply unsettling visuals proper tension movie reliant jump scare get tedious however fair amount jump scare good build payoff scare also love sound design film director us effectively create creepy feeling first act film well done see main character rose sosie bacon slowly descend madness curse becomes prominent note sosie bacon phenomenal main lead give convincing performance someone losing mind nevertheless film fall lot generic trope horror movie plot original seen film like follows ring lot beat beat element seen dozen time even ending something seen horror movie main character also say incredibly stupid thing also moment film unintentionally funny silly meant serious moment overall well made horror film especially director first film still never really go beyond generic horror movie want something different horror genre still look forward parker finn next though promising
"Having just watched this movie at a family members insistance ,i have to say that i was rather disappointed after leaving the movie theatre. There was alot of Hoopla about this also .Movie critics were raving about it from what i heard .But after watching this i just found it to be pretty boring and predictable especially towards the end ,i kind of already figured out what was going to happen .All in all i found the movie just to be a series of Jump Scares and they were'nt really all that scary either and i'm a very big horror fan. I even found one of the scenes that was obiviously meant to be scary and have some type of shock value almost laughable. The only good scene thru out the whole movie i thing was at the start of the film with the first suicide .After that it was just downhill from there in my opinion. Next time i shan't believe the hype from certain movie critics.",watched movie family member insistance say rather disappointed leaving movie theatre alot hoopla also movie critic raving heard watching found pretty boring predictable especially towards end kind already figured going happen found movie series jump scare nt really scary either big horror fan even found one scene obiviously meant scary type shock value almost laughable good scene thru whole movie thing start film first suicide downhill opinion next time believe hype certain movie critic
"LOTS of jump scares and squeamish scenes as expected. Some original horror and a lot of ""been there, done that"" which is fun for a horror junkie like me. BUT. Weak conclusion. Seems like it literally just sets up for a cheesy sequel to come down the road. You'll see what I mean if you were looking for a more meaningful wrap to what could have been a great ending as this story builds and directs the viewer to what could bring to reason.

"A smile has the potential to convey a myriad of varying emotions - love, sadness, misery, embarrassment, anger, happiness, a smile is as versatile as the one wearing it. But can smiles convey fear? ""Smile"" certainly thinks so.After witnessing a bizarre, traumatic incident involving a patient, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing frightening occurrences that she can't explain. Rose must confront her troubling past in order to survive and escape her horrifying new reality (shout out IMDb for that synopsis). Does this sound like a familiar premise? Maybe, or maybe not. While - at first - a seemingly original idea, as ""Smile"" plays in front of your very eyes, you'll begin to realize that the film bears a striking resemblance to a certain early 2000's horror film starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (no spoilers here, as Ms. Gellar was quite prolific in the 2000's). That said, the familiarity shouldn't matter as long as ""Smile"" delivers on the horror it has promised, and maybe bewitches audiences with a few tricks that it has up its own sleeve. And, for the most part, it does.""Smile"" starts very strong, with a shocking and memorable opening that leaves the door wide open for seemingly endless horror possibilities. And the first act really is great. Running with its premise, the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are full of all the creepy shenanigans that you could ever want - there are a couple of jump scares that actually effected me, there was some genuinely disturbing imagery, and the overall theme and concept was intriguing and disturbing enough that I found myself consistently chilled, no thanks to the crisp fall weather. With plenty of paranormal happenings to satisfy even the most jaded viewer, the first act of this film is sure to satisfy, complete with a hefty dose of psychological drama. I was totally engaged during the initial sequences, so much so that I was beginning to be convinced that ""Smile"" would become my favorite scary movie of the year - and then the second act happened.Devolving into a very generic investigation thriller, the second act of ""Smile"" misses much of what made the first act so interesting; and while I know that the investigation of what exactly is happening was meant to further entice viewers and draw interest, I couldn't help but think that the movie would've worked better with more ambiguity and less on-the-nose exposition and metaphors. The third act is really when the familiarity comes to the surface, and that's when my enjoyment started to run thin. However, the ending almost made up for it - even though I predicted what was going to happen, I still found how things wrapped up to be very narratively satisfying.Is this movie scary? Not really. It has creepy imagery and a handful of jump scares, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen before in an early 2000's Sarah Michelle Gellar film (could it be ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed""?). That said, the story that ""Smile"" decides to tell - while predictable - is still entertaining, with many moments that will thrill and chill viewers. This isn't the scariest or the most original horror film out there, but it's perfect to watch during so-called spooky season if you can temper your expectations and just enjoy the ride.",smile potential convey myriad varying emotion love sadness misery embarrassment anger happiness smile versatile one wearing smile convey fear smile certainly think witnessing bizarre traumatic incident involving patient dr rose cotter start experiencing frightening occurrence explain rose must confront troubling past order survive escape horrifying new reality shout imdb synopsis sound like familiar premise maybe maybe first seemingly original idea smile play front eye begin realize film bear striking resemblance certain early horror film starring sarah michelle gellar spoiler m gellar quite prolific said familiarity matter long smile delivers horror promised maybe bewitches audience trick sleeve part smile start strong shocking memorable opening leaf door wide open seemingly endless horror possibility first act really great running premise first minute movie full creepy shenanigan could ever want couple jump scare actually effected genuinely disturbing imagery overall theme concept intriguing disturbing enough found consistently chilled thanks crisp fall weather plenty paranormal happening satisfy even jaded viewer first act film sure satisfy complete hefty dose psychological drama totally engaged initial sequence much beginning convinced smile would become favorite scary movie year second act happened devolving generic investigation thriller second act smile miss much made first act interesting know investigation exactly happening meant entice viewer draw interest help think movie would worked better ambiguity le nose exposition metaphor third act really familiarity come surface enjoyment started run thin however ending almost made even though predicted going happen still found thing wrapped narratively satisfying movie scary really creepy imagery handful jump scare nothing seen early sarah michelle gellar film could scooby doo monster unleashed said story smile decides tell predictable still entertaining many moment thrill chill viewer scariest original horror film perfect watch called spooky season temper expectation enjoy ride
"This was a movie that when I saw part of the trailer, I was intrigued. It was one that I missed opening weekend but made sure that I caught it at the Gateway Film Center before it left. I heard mostly positive things so that helped as well.Synopsis: after seeing a bizarre, traumatic incident involving a patient, Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) starts experiencing frighting occurrences that she can't explain. Rose must confront her troubling past to survive and escape her horrifying reality.We start this off seeing a woman in bed. The camera pans to show us pills have fallen on the floor and this is mostly likely a suicide. It then shifts to show us a girl watching on. There's a scream before we jump to the present. That girl was Rose. She is a doctor in the emergency room of a hospital. We will learn through her boss, Dr. Morgan Desai (Kal Penn), that she's been working long hours. There is an incident with Carl Renken (Jack Sochet) who must be re-admitted. This isn't his first time.Rose is trying to go home when Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey) comes in. She saw a professor commit suicide and she's been struggling since. Rose tries to ask her questions and shockingly, Laura is lucid. She explains that she is a Ph. D. student and that she isn't crazy. She claims though to see something that looks like people but isn't. Rose tries to make sense of this when the young woman kills herself.This is something heavy to take home. She is shaken by it. Rose also thinks she sees something in her house that night. She is spooked when her fianc√© comes home and she doesn't hear him. His name is Trevor (Jessie T. Usher). He tries to help her. He also reminds her that they have dinner with her sister, Holly (Gillian Zinser) and her husband, Greg (Nick Arapoglou).Things take a dark turn for Rose. She is exhausted from work. She is also carrying baggage from a traumatic event she just experienced and from her past. Weird things are happening to her. She has to figure out if they are really or is it the stress of all this catching up with her. This explores more into her past with her sister as well as a past boyfriend. He is a detective assigned to the suicide, Joel (Kyle Gallner). There seems to be a pattern here with the 'curse' that she believes she has inherited. This explores some dark subject matter to get to the bottom of this.That is where I'll leave my recap for this movie and introduction of the characters. Where I want to start is that this feels like an American take on the classic J-Horror haunting stories. If you look at this on the base level, this could be like the Ring, The Grudge or Pulse. Rose did something without even realizing it and is cursed. What makes this even more interesting to me though is the back-story that they set up for her where there could also be a logical explanation to everything as well.With that set up, I want to explore the supernatural angle first. I like the approach the movie takes here. They are using different people who are dependable before descending into madness. What I mean is that we have Rose, who is a doctor. Laura was a Ph. D. student. The person before her was a college professor. These are all people that in normal sense, we would believe when they tell us things. It isn't your typical schizophrenic patient to start. There is a history of mental illness with Rose though. Despite this, the logic for Rose to think there could be this entity haunting her feel real. I'd say most of the audience would believe as well. It is just the rational explanation for people around her to not.Now to the other side. You could look at it how Trevor, Holly or even Joel at first. Curses aren't real. Rose has trauma from her past that is unresolved. She's been in therapy, but no longer. Seeing someone kill themselves in front of her could trigger her back into that mental state. Long hours at work and not sleeping can also contribute here as well. I don't believe this is the case, but I love that there is this explanation here. It makes things much more impactful in my opinion.To stick with this idea, I do have a bit of a negative here. I saw someone knock the film about the message that they're trying to convey. I do agree with them to an extent. This movie is exploring mental illness. Rose works with patients like this and wants to help. A bit of this is with what happened to her mother. She is trying to compensate. Holly moved on. Rose truly hasn't. I like how this movie looks at mental illness. It takes it seriously. The only character who isn't is Rose herself. To explain this just a bit more, she cares about those around her and their mental state. She isn't taking care of her own. How this movie ends didn't work for me as well. I believe the entity is real. This ending goes bleak and I don't know if it works as well as I would have liked. What is interesting is this contradicts what I want in my films and I acknowledge that.Going along with that, I do feel that the ending they went with potentially sets them up for a sequel. I heard a podcast review on this ahead of me getting my thoughts down. They liked something that I did as well. We don't know what this creature is. They compared it to It Follows in the sense that the only things they know are the facts of earlier cases. I love the idea that a person must commit suicide in front of someone else to continue it on. That is bleak in general. The only thing I'll allude to for the ending is what I've already said. They could continue this if they want to. They will need to delve a bit more in the entity if they do. Personally, I'm fine if this stays as a one and done. This feels complete.Where I'll then go would be the acting. I thought that Bacon was good as our lead. This is pretty much a character study of her. We spend the duration with her and I thought she carried this. We get a bit brief glimpse, but we never see her normal. In the beginning, she is tired. I like that from there we follow as she tries to break this 'curse'. Gallner is an actor I like and I thought he was solid here as Joel. Usher is an interesting role. He doesn't seem to be great for Rose so I like where that goes. Robin Weigert is good in her limited role as a psychiatrist for our lead. The rest of the cast are good in pushing her to her she ends up as well. This includes Stasey, Penn, Rob Morgan, Zinser, Judy Reyes, Sochet and Arapoglou.Where I'll end this out will be with the filmmaking. What I thought was great was the cinematography. They do great things with setting up shots. This includes depth of focus, the use of shadows and hiding things in it. I was thoroughly impressed there. Going along with that, I'd even say that the effects used are good. There is CGI, but to be honest there were only a couple of times that I don't think it looked good. If I do have a gripe though, this runs too long. It comes in at almost 2 hours. I think this could be trimmed to an hour and half to run tighter. The only other aspect would be the soundtrack. It is eerie and made me feel uncomfortable. It was used strategic. This used a good number of jump scares as well. I'll be honest. I'm normally not a fan, but here I thought they were used effectively.In conclusion, this is a solid movie. I came in not expecting this to be as good as it was since this is a more mainstream, but it has a mean streak to it. There are heavy subject matters explored and I think they do well there. The ending might drop the ball a bit in that respect. I like there being a potential curse or just our character finally hitting her breaking point. Bacon was solid. Everyone else pushes her to where she needs to end up. I thought the filmmaking here was good as well. The cinematography and soundtrack are great. There is a bit heavier with the CGI, but that wasn't an issue for me. It does run too long though. Not enough to ruin it, but I felt the runtime. I thoroughly enjoyed this one to be honest.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",movie saw part trailer intrigued one missed opening weekend made sure caught gateway film center left heard mostly positive thing helped well synopsis seeing bizarre traumatic incident involving patient dr rose cotter sosie bacon start experiencing frighting occurrence explain rose must confront troubling past survive escape horrifying reality start seeing woman bed camera pan show u pill fallen floor mostly likely suicide shift show u girl watching scream jump present girl rose doctor emergency room hospital learn bos dr morgan desai kal penn working long hour incident carl renken jack sochet must admitted first time rose trying go home laura weaver caitlin stasey come saw professor commit suicide struggling since rose try ask question shockingly laura lucid explains ph student crazy claim though see something look like people rose try make sense young woman kill something heavy take home shaken rose also think see something house night spooked fianc come home hear name trevor jessie usher try help also reminds dinner sister holly gillian zinser husband greg nick arapoglou thing take dark turn rose exhausted work also carrying baggage traumatic event experienced past weird thing happening figure really stress catching explores past sister well past boyfriend detective assigned suicide joel kyle gallner seems pattern curse belief inherited explores dark subject matter get bottom leave recap movie introduction character want start feel like american take classic j horror haunting story look base level could like ring grudge pulse rose something without even realizing cursed make even interesting though back story set could also logical explanation everything well set want explore supernatural angle first like approach movie take using different people dependable descending madness mean rose doctor laura ph student person college professor people normal sense would believe tell u thing typical schizophrenic patient start history mental illness rose though despite logic rose think could entity haunting feel real say audience would believe well rational explanation people around side could look trevor holly even joel first curse real rose trauma past unresolved therapy longer seeing someone kill front could trigger back mental state long hour work sleeping also contribute well believe case love explanation make thing much impactful opinion stick idea bit negative saw someone knock film message trying convey agree extent movie exploring mental illness rose work patient like want help bit happened mother trying compensate holly moved rose truly like movie look mental illness take seriously character rose explain bit care around mental state taking care movie end work well believe entity real ending go bleak know work well would liked interesting contradicts want film acknowledge going along feel ending went potentially set sequel heard podcast review ahead getting thought liked something well know creature compared follows sense thing know fact earlier case love idea person must commit suicide front someone else continue bleak general thing allude ending already said could continue want need delve bit entity personally fine stay one done feel complete go would acting thought bacon good lead pretty much character study spend duration thought carried get bit brief glimpse never see normal beginning tired like follow try break curse gallner actor like thought solid joel usher interesting role seem great rose like go robin weigert good limited role psychiatrist lead rest cast good pushing end well includes stasey penn rob morgan zinser judy reyes sochet arapoglou end filmmaking thought great cinematography great thing setting shot includes depth focus use shadow hiding thing thoroughly impressed going along even say effect used good cgi honest couple time think looked good gripe though run long come almost hour think could trimmed hour half run tighter aspect would soundtrack eerie made feel uncomfortable used strategic used good number jump scare well honest normally fan thought used effectively conclusion solid movie came expecting good since mainstream mean streak heavy subject matter explored think well ending might drop ball bit respect like potential curse character finally hitting breaking point bacon solid everyone else push need end thought filmmaking good well cinematography soundtrack great bit heavier cgi issue run long though enough ruin felt runtime thoroughly enjoyed one honest rating
Didnt have high expectations for this horror film but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of smile. Lead actress was brilliant and the director did a great job at building the looming dread. This reminded me of hereditary but with way more scares.The rest of the viewers really seemed to enjoy it. Some moments in the film really got the viewers involved. The only slightly disappointing thing about the film was the ending. It wasn't a terrible ending but maybe it was a bit over the top and might put people off.If you like horror movies I can't see how you wouldn't enjoy this movie. From the very first scene it gets you hooked.,didnt high expectation horror film pleasantly surprised quality smile lead actress brilliant director great job building looming dread reminded hereditary way scare rest viewer really seemed enjoy moment film really got viewer involved slightly disappointing thing film ending terrible ending maybe bit top might put people like horror movie see enjoy movie first scene get hooked

"This psychological chiller is directed and written by Parker Finn and doesn't give up on making you feel very uneasy. Has enough to be one of the best horror flicks released in the last couple of years. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a somewhat passive therapist not afraid to allow herself to be overworked. After witnessing one of her patients take their own life, Rose takes ownership of scary hallucinations, one after another, possibly caused by a demonic entity that makes its victims flash a hideous grin. Rose is confronted by her own troubled past and can't escape it. She seems to be watching a parade of expired souls leaving life more traumatic than the one before. Jump scares, chills and shivers to enjoy a good while.",psychological chiller directed written parker finn give making feel uneasy enough one best horror flick released last couple year dr rose cotter sosie bacon somewhat passive therapist afraid allow overworked witnessing one patient take life rose take ownership scary hallucination one another possibly caused demonic entity make victim flash hideous grin rose confronted troubled past escape seems watching parade expired soul leaving life traumatic one jump scare chill shiver enjoy good
"The entity in this movie, right from the beginning, just seems so utterly undefeatable.And so, when something can constantly alter your visual perception completely, then what hope is there really? Thus right from the start this movie seems hopeless, causing me to ask myself,""Why should I bother to watch? It's just going to get her in the end,"" as it does, and in a highly predictable way.Resulting in an overall hopeless and gloomy feel of watching a train wreck in slow motion. Which is not really a fun way to enjoy horror, nor will it leave me raving about the movie being ""mind blowing!"".",entity movie right beginning seems utterly undefeatable something constantly alter visual perception completely hope really thus right start movie seems hopeless causing ask bother watch going get end highly predictable way resulting overall hopeless gloomy feel watching train wreck slow motion really fun way enjoy horror leave raving movie mind blowing
"It was a decent idea, but we've definitely seen this before (It Follows, The Ring, The Grudge). Sosie Bacon was definitely the standout, her performance was strong enough to carry this film. There are jump scares galore, some work and some just feel redundant and overused. Nice cinematography, but creative camera shots/angles don't help a lacking story. And the pacing did seem to drag a bit in parts. The music/soundtrack is what I really enjoyed. Imaginative use of interesting sounds here, especially during the end credits!! I would recommend viewing it in a theater just for the sound quality alone.",decent idea definitely seen follows ring grudge sosie bacon definitely standout performance strong enough carry film jump scare galore work feel redundant overused nice cinematography creative camera shot angle help lacking story pacing seem drag bit part music soundtrack really enjoyed imaginative use interesting sound especially end credit would recommend viewing theater sound quality alone
"I sat down to watch the 2022 horror movie ""Smile"", after having heard this and that much about it being one of the most scary and memorable horror movies of 2022. So, yeah, of course I had to watch ""Smile"".And I will say that writer and director Parker Finn left me with precious little to smile about. Wow, this movie was overrated. It was by all means a subpar addition to the horror genre, where writer and director Parker Finn had perhaps seen a bit too much Japanese horror, ""Ringu"" of course, and opted to make a movie similar to that, but with a little bit of a twist to it.The storyline in ""Smile"" was generic, and very much akin to ""Ringu"", except it wasn't a videotape that transferred the curse, but instead it was witnessing a suicide. The storyline was rather generic, even for a horror movie. Sure, there were a couple of attempts at making the audience gasp with some good old fashioned jump scares, but believe me when I say that the narrative holds nothing scary.The cast ensemble was for the most parts unfamiliar faces to me, and that is something I enjoy when I watch movies. I only recognized Kyle Gallner and Kal Penn here on the cast list. The actors and actresses on the cast list did fair enough jobs with their given characters, though they had very little solid contents to work with from the script.Visually then ""Smile"" is adequate. But again, it doesn't really bring anything grand or revolutionary to the horror genre. There was a couple of scenes with some mutilations, that was basically it. So I wasn't particularly pleased here, as a life-long gorehound.If you enjoy horror movies, perhaps give ""Smile"" a view if you are relatively new to the genre, then you might get a kick out of writer and director Parker Finn's 2022 movie. However, I have been watching horror movies for more than 35+ years, so ""Smile"" didn't really do it for me.I was genuinely disappointed with how subpar and generic ""Smile"" was, especially after all the hype that there had been surrounding it.My rating of ""Smile"" lands on a three out of ten stars, so there really isn't much to smile about is there?",sat watch horror movie smile heard much one scary memorable horror movie yeah course watch smile say writer director parker finn left precious little smile wow movie overrated mean subpar addition horror genre writer director parker finn perhaps seen bit much japanese horror ringu course opted make movie similar little bit twist storyline smile generic much akin ringu except videotape transferred curse instead witnessing suicide storyline rather generic even horror movie sure couple attempt making audience gasp good old fashioned jump scare believe say narrative hold nothing scary cast ensemble part unfamiliar face something enjoy watch movie recognized kyle gallner kal penn cast list actor actress cast list fair enough job given character though little solid content work script visually smile adequate really bring anything grand revolutionary horror genre couple scene mutilation basically particularly pleased life long gorehound enjoy horror movie perhaps give smile view relatively new genre might get kick writer director parker finn movie however watching horror movie year smile really genuinely disappointed subpar generic smile especially hype surrounding rating smile land three ten star really much smile
"A not so bright movie, kinda having a concept like The Ring, but with a much weaker screenplay, vibe, flow, acting, thrill and horror factors.Ironically, the best actress in my opinion who has her picture as the first victim all over the movie links is sent to oblivion in the first 15 minutes chapter.After that it's just a mishmash of scenes, good visual effects and CGI overall, but with a weak flow and a main actress who just acts like a wooden old doll.The film rolls until the last scene and chapter with a cliched ending that viewers most probably saw from a mile away.I suspect that the producers prepared the ground for a potentially weaker sequel !Screenplay/story: 7

"The scares are predictable but entertaining, the acting is great, directing is good and unsettling and the music is effectively eerie which all combine to give Smile a good basis for a smash hit horror, so why the average score? What could have been a great film is let down with its mediocre plot that borrows heavily from other films which have done this well trodden story much more effectively. Take a sprinkle of The Ring a dash of Sinister and mix with a full measure of Fallen and overcook for nearly two hours and this is what you get, still entertaining but not nearly as original as it thinks it is, and overstays it's welcome by about 20 minutes.",scare predictable entertaining acting great directing good unsettling music effectively eerie combine give smile good basis smash hit horror average score could great film let mediocre plot borrows heavily film done well trodden story much effectively take sprinkle ring dash sinister mix full measure fallen overcook nearly two hour get still entertaining nearly original think overstays welcome minute
"Now this one started off with some promise. We had a fun mix of jump scares and fake outs, accented by some genuinely funny and clever comedy. Sure some of the acting was a bit off and on the over the top side of things, but it was entertaining and written interestingly enough to off set that. It was when the film decided to play things straight faced for the last half of the film that it really falls apart. It starts playing into horror movie tropes instead of making fun of them, which made the film extremely predictable by the end. My other gripe with the film is how long it was. Far too long for the premise it was presenting and it felt like a lot of the story scenes were just filler material to move the film along, as opposed to finding out new things about this creature, or entity. Actually, I'm not sure what it is as it's never really touched on. We do get to see the creature and I thought it was a joke. Just silly, and reminded me of the creature reveal in the recent, Barbarian. Too silly to take seriously. Maybe the studios will understand that most of us are sick of seeing the same horror movies, over and over again, just reworked, but I think that's wishful thinking. 2.5 smiles out of 5.",one started promise fun mix jump scare fake out accented genuinely funny clever comedy sure acting bit top side thing entertaining written interestingly enough set film decided play thing straight faced last half film really fall apart start playing horror movie trope instead making fun made film extremely predictable end gripe film long far long premise presenting felt like lot story scene filler material move film along opposed finding new thing creature entity actually sure never really touched get see creature thought joke silly reminded creature reveal recent barbarian silly take seriously maybe studio understand u sick seeing horror movie reworked think wishful thinking smile
"I'm late to the party so there's a lot of reviews out there to surely bury my own at this point, but for anyone checking more recent reviews-This film borrows a lot from It Follows, and some from Oculus and Truth or Dare, with the very predictable final act feeling a bit inspired by the original Evil Dead as well. The idea of a downward-turned head and eyes looking up through a cheerful smile being something ironic or sinister in horror is not new itself, either. It felt to me as if the director just said ""hey, I'm going to take the smile from Truth or Dare, the hallucinations from Oculus, the cabin from Evil Dead, and the stalking and paranoia of It Follows and make the ultimate horror movie!""
Unfortunately, for anyone who isn't a teenager sneaking into an R rated film for their first time, this whole hand was overplayed and felt generic and forgettable. It started out spooky and ended up hilarious when they show too much of the monster and even have it speaking cheesy lines. You never show too much of your monster, and should rarely have it speak- it's a critical mistake that too many filmmakers never seem to learn. If you can steal from those before you, you should also be able to learn from their mistakes. 5/10 stars.

"I'll first start with the good of the movie. The movie itself is really engaging, the characters are really well played as well. The jumpscares are good. The final teaching was probably that we should face our demons instead of always running away from them - and also how important it is to not traumatise people with our problems. So far so good.The plot itself is cliche - ''aah some evil power is chasing me, no one believes me, i'm so scared and don't know what to do'' - it's fine, though, we are all used to this.But the ending was so terrible. So, basically, she shut herself in in order to not hurt anyone. I thought that she was either going to a) kill herself or b) beat her own devil by moving on. That's what the story implies it's going to happen. Makes sense - that's what I'd try to do too - not drag anyone into a literal curse, and try to solve it myself or die trying.Nope - she doesn't. She still regrets soft-killing her deadbeat mom 20 years ago. But how can this even get worse? She refuses to kill herself when she has time, and she drags the only person who has ever loved her for who she was and did everything for her - Joel. Joel, the guy who was willing to throw away everything for a girl that did not even belong to him - dies in the pursuit of saving her because she simply couldn't end it on her own. I have no problem with the villain winning - I'm all for it. But why do we kill Joel and let Trevor and her sister live?And how about the thousand unanswered questions like what happens to the fiance? What happens to the sister? The little traumatised nephew? Nope, we cut them out of the story.I want to end on a positive note. This movie speaks a lot about trauma and the damage it has upon us. The human mind is inherently very weak, ''inviting'' to negative energy, that seeing a suicide, a dead person or someone hurting in front of us could leave a permanent scar that will haunt us. The movie also shows that society doesn't really want to listen to sickened people - they just want things to be normal and to get things off their hands (Trevor) and pass it to ''professionals'' who just want to get their paychecks (her personal psychologist and her boss).",first start good movie movie really engaging character really well played well jumpscares good final teaching probably face demon instead always running away also important traumatise people problem far good plot cliche aah evil power chasing one belief scared know fine though used ending terrible basically shut order hurt anyone thought either going kill b beat devil moving story implies going happen make sense try drag anyone literal curse try solve die trying nope still regret soft killing deadbeat mom year ago even get worse refuse kill time drag person ever loved everything joel joel guy willing throw away everything girl even belong dy pursuit saving simply end problem villain winning kill joel let trevor sister live thousand unanswered question like happens fiance happens sister little traumatised nephew nope cut story want end positive note movie speaks lot trauma damage upon u human mind inherently weak inviting negative energy seeing suicide dead person someone hurting front u could leave permanent scar haunt u movie also show society really want listen sickened people want thing normal get thing hand trevor pas professional want get paycheck personal psychologist bos
"This was good. It didn't scare me at all-I found it unsettling, creepy, and unnerving rather than horrifying, though there were some very good jump scares-I mean, if a movie is going to rely on such gimmicks, at least this one did it RIGHT. The soundtrack is weird and eerie-reminds me of 70s horror background music a little, and is strangely apropos to the gloomy setting (seriously, WHY do all these people live in impossibly neat, gray houses? Most real people leave things lying around, and live in rooms with colors. Just saying.) The best thing about this movie is definitely Sosie Bacon-I was so impressed with her, and honestly I think she acts rings around both her parents....she did a great job of somehow causing the audience to root for a frankly unlikeable character (Rose) even if it's one who is near impossible to sympathize with or to like. Rose is a whiny, entitled, jealous person who blames her misfortunes on everyone but herself, and has an unbelievable level of naivete about why no one believes her demon story (hello....you killed your cat, wrapped him up in a box, and gave him to your nephew for a present. But yeah, the demon made you do it-they just don't understand.) She is a shrink, yet she has a complete and total inability to stand in another person's shoes and comprehend that not everyone deals with trauma in the same way. I really, really disliked this chick on a personal level, yet Sosie Bacon showed a scrappy, tough side to Rose that makes you root for her anyway, even if you don't like her much. The ending felt like something of a copout-it's one of those that has you blinking at the end credits, asking, ""Wait. That's IT?"" but it does leave open the possibility of a sequel, so there's that.**I recommend this to anyone who isn't triggered by suicide, traumatized children, or animal harm-the cat scene is difficult-RIP Mustache.**",good scare found unsettling creepy unnerving rather horrifying though good jump scare mean movie going rely gimmick least one right soundtrack weird eerie reminds horror background music little strangely apropos gloomy setting seriously people live impossibly neat gray house real people leave thing lying around live room color saying best thing movie definitely sosie bacon impressed honestly think act ring around parent great job somehow causing audience root frankly unlikeable character rose even one near impossible sympathize like rose whiny entitled jealous person blame misfortune everyone unbelievable level naivete one belief demon story hello killed cat wrapped box gave nephew present yeah demon made understand shrink yet complete total inability stand another person shoe comprehend everyone deal trauma way really really disliked chick personal level yet sosie bacon showed scrappy tough side rose make root anyway even like much ending felt like something copout one blinking end credit asking wait leave open possibility sequel recommend anyone triggered suicide traumatized child animal harm cat scene difficult rip mustache

"Smile tells the story of Dr. Rose Cotter(Sosie Bacon). Rose witnesses a shocking incident, involving a patient. Soon, strange and unexplained events take place all around her. Rose has to figure things out, before it's too late.Smile is a jaw-droppingly superb film. Writer-director Parker Finn has given us a one of a kind, mind-blowing & super scary movie. The jump scares will make you fly off your seat. The suspense is maintained throughout the film, along with a growing sense of dread. The tension builds up perfectly, leading to the unforgettable climax, which will leave you speechless. The ending was a bit of a letdown but, this is a minor gripe. Sosie Bacon is spectacular as Rose Cotter. Bacon carries the film on her shoulders, with her mesmerizing performance & you just can't look away, even for a second. Sosie Bacon has a long & bright future ahead of her, in Hollywood. Kyle Gallner is outstanding as Joel. Jessie T. Usher is brilliant as Trevor.

"A horror movie often depends on the acting to believe in how scared you should be and the acting here is superb by the whole cast. This movie had minimal visual effects and relied on the actors to create fear and genuinely creepy imagery. This is a slow burn with enough jump scares to keep you going but the psychological thriller aspect is where this movie really shines. I also liked that the characters mostly did what real people would do, so the story maintained its believability and I wasn't shaking my fist at the characters for making dumb choices.

"Have you seen the movie The Ring? It's basically that. No big twist, no surprise ending. No solution. This movie is trash. Save your money. And why do these people always come from trauma? You know what I want to see? A thriller that happens to a completely normal person whose friends and family believe are in trouble and want to help instead of cutting them off. Also, you know what would've made a better movie? When the main character found out she had the evil thing, she should've just killed herself alone somewhere where someone could find her and where the evil couldn't jump to another person.",seen movie ring basically big twist surprise ending solution movie trash save money people always come trauma know want see thriller happens completely normal person whose friend family believe trouble want help instead cutting also know would made better movie main character found evil thing killed alone somewhere someone could find evil jump another person
"What a roller coaster of a movie! At first, I'm sitting there, watching it, trying to figure out what's going on, what's the conceit, what's the gimmick or message and... I'll admit, it took me a minute. Once I clued in, I was pretty psyched. A movie highlighting psychological trauma and the scars that can leave on a person, the way others look at and view someone with these issues? Movie was speaking my language. But then, third act and... I hate this movie. I give it a few points for that middle section, but so much of that gets undone when the horror movie just has to horror and completely ignores the whole message and opts for stereotypical nonsense that I found to be quite wretched. I was hoping for Babadook, a movie that terrifies but also stays on point and ends with something meaningful. Instead, Smile puts this idea out there and ends with, ""Sucks to suck, guess you're screwed!"" It's a horrible message, irresponsible and upsetting.But, gotta try and get that sequel money, right?",roller coaster movie first sitting watching trying figure going conceit gimmick message admit took minute clued pretty psyched movie highlighting psychological trauma scar leave person way others look view someone issue movie speaking language third act hate movie give point middle section much get undone horror movie horror completely ignores whole message opts stereotypical nonsense found quite wretched hoping babadook movie terrifies also stay point end something meaningful instead smile put idea end suck suck guess screwed horrible message irresponsible upsetting gotta try get sequel money right

"It's not often that you find a horror film that genuinely disturbs you and makes you jump out of your seat, but this film is exactly that. The cinematography is amazing, soundtrack exceptional and the right amount of scares. The story itself is simple yet truly terrifying and leaves you feeling genuinely uneasy, with a good balance of humour thrown into the mix which makes for a very unique watch.I was sceptical given the previous reviews and anything less than a rating of 7 is usually a no go for me, but this was a masterpiece and I am 100% going to see it again, it did not disappoint and you will not regret it!",often find horror film genuinely disturbs make jump seat film exactly cinematography amazing soundtrack exceptional right amount scare story simple yet truly terrifying leaf feeling genuinely uneasy good balance humour thrown mix make unique watch sceptical given previous review anything le rating usually go masterpiece going see disappoint regret
"Seriously I could've stayed home and watched a real horror movie. She knows about 30 min into the movie what she needs to do to end the cycle. But no, we go on this ridiculous ride for another 90 minutes until she finally succumbs to this evil creature/entity they never fully explain. I'm not sure who signed off on this movie but the only thing that would've saved it is if she actually defeated this thing. There's nothing wrong with ending on a sour note, but Rose qas so ridiculously pathetic it was hard to have any sort of empathy for her character. What is it with this trend of horror films that aren't scary? It's like how can we disturb you? Disturbing is not horror. I cannot NOT recommend this movie enough.

"Smile was well acted and intense, despite not being original. It borrows heavily from 'It Follows', 'The Ring', and a little bit of Insidious.The main lead's acting was great and I truly sympatized with her. The supporting cast was serviceable but forgettable.I initially thought the movie was going to end well with a good depiction of overcoming trauma, but - then the ACTUAL ending happened which was generic horror crap. I was left really annoyed after being so invested for near two hours. Watch this for the cheap jump scares, but don't expect this movie to be rewatchable due to the terrible ending.",smile well acted intense despite original borrows heavily follows ring little bit insidious main lead acting great truly sympatized supporting cast serviceable forgettable initially thought movie going end well good depiction overcoming trauma actual ending happened generic horror crap left really annoyed invested near two hour watch cheap jump scare expect movie rewatchable due terrible ending
"Smile at its core is very reminiscent of the horror style of James Wan. It has excellent suspense and beautiful cinematography. Where the film is let down is it's jumpscares. There were a few I found to be profoundly unsettling but a majority did sadly miss the mark. However I will say it didn't detract from how dark and uncomfortable this film is. It's tone is perfect and the lead actor carried the film in its weaker moments.And overall I would still say this film is quite scary. It's final act was superb. No spoilers, but I do have to mention the ending.I was worried about the film flaking on its core message and giving us just another jumpfest of a finale and while again there were jumps, it actually ended in quite a brave way. The script fully commits and embraces the core themes and ends on a devastatingly haunting note.I was very surprised and really did enjoy this film, despite some of its flaws. I especially enjoyed the films obvious inspiration from films such as the ring, insidious and saint maud. Three horror films I quite enjoy. And I also loved it's core themes surrounding trauma and mental health instead of just being ""Spooky monster film"" while also managing to have a spooky monster too.",smile core reminiscent horror style james wan excellent suspense beautiful cinematography film let jumpscares found profoundly unsettling majority sadly miss mark however say detract dark uncomfortable film tone perfect lead actor carried film weaker moment overall would still say film quite scary final act superb spoiler mention ending worried film flaking core message giving u another jumpfest finale jump actually ended quite brave way script fully commits embrace core theme end devastatingly haunting note surprised really enjoy film despite flaw especially enjoyed film obvious inspiration film ring insidious saint maud three horror film quite enjoy also loved core theme surrounding trauma mental health instead spooky monster film also managing spooky monster
"Films like this are the prime example of why I take these ratings with massive grains of salt. The premise is interesting and entertaining but the writing and overall execution is terribly off. This film is closer to 3 out of 10 than 7 out of 10.The amount of incompetence and stupidity shown by virtually everyone in this movie throughout the whole runtime is mind numbing. I LOVE horror movies but this one has two of the tropes I absolutely hate: unnecessary jump scares that don't add to the plot or scene, and dumb characters that see something bad coming at them but instead of running or fighting they either fall over themselves and act like they need life alert to get back up or flat out just stand there and look stupid until it's too late. So many times in this movie there were chances for characters to do something, literally anything, but instead they just stand around like they're rooted to the floor and watch whatever bad thing happen even when they 100% know it'll come at their own detrimentFairly early on in the movie the lead gets some very solid tangible physical evidence that shows that something weird is definitely going on. Instead of opening with said evidence she chooses to start conversations by saying things like ""my eyes are finally open and now I see the truth"" which sounds exactly like something a crazy person would say so no one listens to her. At every chance she got to say or show someone something to get them to believe her she went the opposite way and chose to say or do something wild or stupid. Her actions or lack there of made it feel like she didn't want them to believe herThere was literally 0 explanation about the who/what/why of the plot. We didn't find out who or what the entity is, why any of this is happening in this location, how/why the entity chooses its victims, or why the entity makes its victims give that weird smile. It's like the writers and directors didn't think the premise would be intriguing enough to provoke questions so they didn't bother to give any answers. I get that in horror sometimes it's best to leave things ambiguous, but literally nothing is explained even the slightest bit hereLastly, whoever wrote the fiancÃ©'s part of the script must not have ever been engaged/married because dude was useless all film and was barely in it. She confides in him (a crazy theory albeit) and dude doesn't try to comfort or calm her whatsoever and reacts by basically telling her she's crazy just like her mentally ill mother. Then when I thought he couldn't be any worse of a partner he proved me wrong. If you think your spouse could be having a mental breakdown (if not some other weird stuff going on) and they run out of the house when you try to help them would you: A) chase/follow them to try to calm them down or at the very least make sure they don't do anything harmful, or B) watch them leave, sit back down on the couch and send them 2 texts over the next 2 days asking where they are? These geniuses thought option B was a good idea. And with some of the other subplots they chose to go with why was he even in the movie?Don't believe the hype on this, I did and I was severely disappointed.

"'Smile (2022)' is a fairly lazy horror film that follows the formula of its specific subgenre pretty much to a tee, wearing its influences on its sleeve and having a halfhearted stab at the now-common 'trauma as horror' vibe. It's essentially like a poor man's version of 'Ringu (1998)' (or, perhaps more specifcally, 'The Ring (2002)'), 'It Follows (2014)', 'Hereditary (2018)' and even 'The Happening (2008)' all rolled into one. Even its eponymous gimmick isn't actually all that central to its concept. Instead, all that dead-eyed grinning is essentially just a cheap way to introduce some instantly recognisable, pseudo creepy imagery into the flick's aesthetic - and, more importantly, its advertising (the best of which was some viral marketing in which a few actors posed smiling sinisterly in the crowds of various televised events). None of that is to imply that the picture is especially bad, though. While it takes itself far too seriously for its own good (despite the occasional moment of attempted humour, which sadly all falls entirely flat), the flick is more or less compelling for its duration. It has some suitably unsettling sequences (there's a genuinely frightening special effect at the centre of the best one) and a couple of fairly effective jump scares (even though most of them are entirely too predictable). Its floaty camerawork, atmospheric score and brighter-than-usual colour palette (there are a lot of welcome pink and blue hues here) come together to craft a fairly distinct ambiance that always just feels slightly off. This uncanny air is probably the strongest element of the entire picture; it sort of allows the piece to coast by on vibes alone. The story is, essentially, barely there and feels even less present thanks to its similarity to other, better work. It doesn't really delve into its major metaphor with any real conviction, going so far as to pull the rug out from under itself solely for some cheap cruelty. If you want any kind of actual commentary on its topic of choice, you'll need to look elsewhere. That's actually a little irresponsible considering the touchy subject matter at the core of the feature, and the narrative doesn't separate itself from the issues at hand enough for its cavalier treatment of them not to feel just a little bit icky. It obviously isn't intended to be taken seriously in that respect, but it doesn't lean into its supernatural ridiculousness enough for its more tangible elements to become heightened beyond the point of relevance. It isn't silly and it isn't sincere, so what is it? Really, that's what prevents it from being anything other than decent enough for what it is. Any ambitions it has of being 'elevated horror', for lack of a better term, are dashed by its innate inability to coalesce its themes and its execution into a cohesive whole; any ambitions it has of being schlocky fun are dashed by its innate inability to divorce itself from the pretence that it might just be able to do so. It's not a bad effort; in fact, it's perfectly watchable. However, it's never quite as engaging or, even, unnerving as you'd like it to be. It's entertaining in its own, increasingly erratic way and it does have its more successful elements, but it's ultimately fairly forgettable stuff that never quite manages to get away from the middle of the road.",smile fairly lazy horror film follows formula specific subgenre pretty much tee wearing influence sleeve halfhearted stab common trauma horror vibe essentially like poor man version ringu perhaps specifcally ring follows hereditary even happening rolled one even eponymous gimmick actually central concept instead dead eyed grinning essentially cheap way introduce instantly recognisable pseudo creepy imagery flick aesthetic importantly advertising best viral marketing actor posed smiling sinisterly crowd various televised event none imply picture especially bad though take far seriously good despite occasional moment attempted humour sadly fall entirely flat flick le compelling duration suitably unsettling sequence genuinely frightening special effect centre best one couple fairly effective jump scare even though entirely predictable floaty camerawork atmospheric score brighter usual colour palette lot welcome pink blue hue come together craft fairly distinct ambiance always feel slightly uncanny air probably strongest element entire picture sort allows piece coast vibe alone story essentially barely feel even le present thanks similarity better work really delve major metaphor real conviction going far pull rug solely cheap cruelty want kind actual commentary topic choice need look elsewhere actually little irresponsible considering touchy subject matter core feature narrative separate issue hand enough cavalier treatment feel little bit icky obviously intended taken seriously respect lean supernatural ridiculousness enough tangible element become heightened beyond point relevance silly sincere really prevents anything decent enough ambition elevated horror lack better term dashed innate inability coalesce theme execution cohesive whole ambition schlocky fun dashed innate inability divorce pretence might able bad effort fact perfectly watchable however never quite engaging even unnerving like entertaining increasingly erratic way successful element ultimately fairly forgettable stuff never quite manages get away middle road
"This is really great horror movie. Forget about everything being said about it! However if someone whatches it with detached mind he must but hope that Rose gets the point and smiles back. I was hoping for that at least. I was hoping that she would understand that all the mess is just in her mind. She will collect herself and end the chain with herself not beleiving in what her mind sees and believes. I guess it would have spoiled the horror theme of it, but it would have a morral behind. It will tell a story of hope out of hell. The point is that it would than become a movie for someone who wants to think on the end of it. It made me think anyways. First about the fact, that whatever our mind is trying to make us believe its our choice to believe it and also, that wiriting such a story will not sell to simple minded people as well. This is exactly the movie that needs to endings. One for adults and one for teenagers and blockbuster seekers.

"Gripping from the get-go and sustaining its eerie vibe from start to finish, Smile is a delightfully deranged psychological horror that makes efficient use of its visual & aural aspects to offer an increasingly unhinged & paranoia-inducing chiller. Serving as an interesting exploration of guilt, grief, trauma & mental illness, the film is also brilliantly anchored by a standout showcase from its leading lady.Written & directed by Parker Finn in his feature directorial debut, the story lifts its premise from his own short film and expands upon its myth & mystery with finesse. It may not be original but the overall execution has a certain effectiveness to it despite all the familiar tropes & trappings of its subgenre. The creepy imagery & dissonant soundscapes contribute to its unnerving aura and it only intensifies as plot progresses.What the film does well is it invokes an atmosphere of dread & claustrophobia from its opening segment and silently escalates the ominous mood. The smooth camerawork & consistent pace further help in ratcheting up the tension & suspense but that doesn't mean there is no room for amusing bits. The jump scares are well-timed, the sense of foreboding is palpable and Sosie Bacon is excellent at capturing her character's unraveling.Overall, Smile is one of the better horror offerings of the year and delivers the grins & grimaces in satisfying doses. The final act is where it falters to an extent, is unable to bring it all together and fails to stick the landing but considering the things it gets right for a debut effort, it's by all means a promising start. A sinister entry that takes ideas from existing examples yet leaves an impression of its own, this gleeful surprise had me smiling maniacally for the most part.",gripping get go sustaining eerie vibe start finish smile delightfully deranged psychological horror make efficient use visual aural aspect offer increasingly unhinged paranoia inducing chiller serving interesting exploration guilt grief trauma mental illness film also brilliantly anchored standout showcase leading lady written directed parker finn feature directorial debut story lift premise short film expands upon myth mystery finesse may original overall execution certain effectiveness despite familiar trope trapping subgenre creepy imagery dissonant soundscapes contribute unnerving aura intensifies plot progress film well invokes atmosphere dread claustrophobia opening segment silently escalates ominous mood smooth camerawork consistent pace help ratcheting tension suspense mean room amusing bit jump scare well timed sense foreboding palpable sosie bacon excellent capturing character unraveling overall smile one better horror offering year delivers grin grimace satisfying dos final act falter extent unable bring together fails stick landing considering thing get right debut effort mean promising start sinister entry take idea existing example yet leaf impression gleeful surprise smiling maniacally part
"It's a fun horror movie to watch, made in 2022. The movie can be said to be the scourge that follows people in the simplest way. It reminded many people like me from the movie ""It Follow"". Again, the movie ""Fallen"" was about a similar follow-up. The movie is good, it is watched with curiosity, and it gives tension from time to time. Especially the first scene is perhaps the most striking part of the movie. I also loved the surprise scenes. It deserves its rating.-spoilersThat dirty laughing thing could have been shown more.

"Smile is everything I hate about modern horror: a plot hijacked from the 90s obsession with Westernizing J-horror, CGI blood, herky jerky cameras, an overreliance on jump cuts, interstitial drone shots and so many sins against my personal cinematic rules. Sure, I love Jess Franco, Jean Rollin, Bruno Mattei, Joe D'Amato and direct to streaming Amityville movies and have no taste, but I still know a movie that has no merit whatsoever when I watch it.A longer version of director and writer Parker Finn's Laura Hasn't Slept, this is totally a short stretched to feature length and all of the issues that that brings. That same Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey) is a patient of Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) and she hasn't slept since she watched her art professor kill himself after an entity hunted him through the smiles of people who proclaimed that he would die. Now she has the same issue and passes it on to our protagonist and then slitting her neck as computerized blood fills the floor. So, you know, The Ring-style curse gets passed on, strange moments of possession of people all around her, a past with a mother who died while she watched...you've seen it all before, but at least this one had a fun ad campaign of smiling people showing up on TV and smiling through news shows and baseball games.Does the protagonist have a cop boyfriend still in love with her? Yes.Does she have a curse that she has to pass on? Yes.Does it toy with the hope of a happy ending only to pull the rug? Yes.Derek Riggs, who created Eddie for Iron Maiden, once told me that someone smiling was the most unsettling visual. He's right. I wish he could have also explained to these filmmakers how to make a better movie not so reliant on cliches, but then again, people have been quick to enshrine this along with other movies that really aren't that special like It Follows and The Babadook, two very simple movies that simply aren't anywhere near as wonderful as people hunting for something to evangelize, empty notions of film that would barely register were so many truly dreadful horror movies being made.

"Sosie Bacon acts her heart out and manages to show incredible talent. It's a shame the movie is so terrible.In a film that relies almost solely on jump scares, it becomes exhausting trying to stay engaged with the story as it develops. As I've mentioned, Sosie Bacon is excellent but she isn't helped by a mostly inept supporting cast playing parodic characters. Her sister is a vacuous insufferable wine mom who apparently married her gay best friend. Her ex is a cop whose partner ineptly uses every single wrong word or phrase to do with mental health, and her fiance - who is one of the talented members of the cast - is usually nothing more than an empty suit used to produce relationship strife.If I had streamed this, I would have turned it off.",sosie bacon act heart manages show incredible talent shame movie terrible film relies almost solely jump scare becomes exhausting trying stay engaged story develops mentioned sosie bacon excellent helped mostly inept supporting cast playing parodic character sister vacuous insufferable wine mom apparently married gay best friend ex cop whose partner ineptly us every single wrong word phrase mental health fiance one talented member cast usually nothing empty suit used produce relationship strife streamed would turned

"4 out of 5 stars.Smile is a good psychological horror film that tries for a lot of jump scares and creepy moments. And it does succeed. It does have a long and slow pacing that distracts you from the film. It borrows similiarities like the movies like It Follows or The Ring. The film follows a pscyhologist after witnessing her patient struggling with some entity chasing her and the smiles of strange things. She starts seeing what her patient is seeing.The plot is good. The film does try for some jump scares. The acting and cast is good. The films direction does feel a little too long than it should have been.

"""Smile"" is definitely one of the better horror flicks of 2022. It starts very strongly, with a fantastic scene from Australian actor Caitlyn Stasey, strong direction and stark, minimalist music to bring out the atmosphere.Unfortunately, it founders towards the end. This is one of those movies which shows, rather than telling but the small amount it shows doesn't sustain our interest until the end.At first, it's very intriguing, and you're asking yourself the classic question that psychological horror always prompts: is the main character crazy, or is she the only sane one?However, by the end, I had lost interest in the answer to this question.""Smile"" is similar to ""It Follows"" in its plot being a metaphor for trauma, and the way traumatised people pass their trauma on to others. This is a very interesting idea. The movie just doesn't give you enough to keep you engaged, or keep you guessing, and it is too long, and has too many dream sequences.In fact, the dream sequences sum up the basic problem with this movie. You can't just keep playing bait and switch and expect us not to get tired of it, you have to give us something real every once in a while.",smile definitely one better horror flick start strongly fantastic scene australian actor caitlyn stasey strong direction stark minimalist music bring atmosphere unfortunately founder towards end one movie show rather telling small amount show sustain interest end first intriguing asking classic question psychological horror always prompt main character crazy sane one however end lost interest answer question smile similar follows plot metaphor trauma way traumatised people pas trauma others interesting idea movie give enough keep engaged keep guessing long many dream sequence fact dream sequence sum basic problem movie keep playing bait switch expect u get tired give u something real every
"Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I actually jumped!!! A couple times!Now, I love horror films. But this one finally scared me!

"Going into this movie based on the trailer I kinda knew what I was getting myself into...but it was so much more than that! The storyline was very well drawn out...the jump scares were terrific. There may have been one too many...but hey...what's a gory horror movie without unexpected, uneccesary jump scares. Another thing I'd like to note is the incredible acting done by this seemingly unknown ensemble cast! It was halfway through the movie that I realized the leading lady was Kevin bacons daughter! And they really found people with the creepiest smile and dead eyes to portray all of our smiling villains! Overall this movie was very enjoyable and scary!",going movie based trailer kinda knew getting much storyline well drawn jump scare terrific may one many hey gory horror movie without unexpected uneccesary jump scare another thing like note incredible acting done seemingly unknown ensemble cast halfway movie realized leading lady kevin bacon daughter really found people creepiest smile dead eye portray smiling villain overall movie enjoyable scary
"The title says it all, I had seen the trailer a couple of times, obviously whatever the plot involved, there were characters with a menacing smile, I was looking forward to hopefully a decent scary movie. Basically, at a psychiatric ward, Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon, daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick) meets PhD student Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey), a recently admitted patient, who witnessed her professor die by suicide. Laura claims that an entity is haunting her, only she can see it, it pretends to be other people she knows or meets, and all are smiling at her. Laura has a panic attack and convulses. As Rose calls for help, Laura smiles at her before cutting her own throat with a shard from a broken vase. Following Laura's apparent suicide, Rose passes the room of vulnerable patient Carl Renken (Jack Sochet), he is catatonic and smiling at her, but eventually starts shouting at her that she is going to die. She orders for Carl to be restrained, but it turns out that Carl had been asleep the whole time. Rose's supervisor Dr. Morgan Desai (Kal Penn) is concerned for her mental well-being, assuming that she has been working too much and has had lack of sleep, he gives her a week-long break. Rose returns home to her fiancé Trevor (Independence Day: Resurgence's Jessie T. Usher) and their cat, Mustache, and tries to relax, but the supernatural occurrences continue. As her visions become increasingly more terrifying, her mental state is questioned by everyone, and her personal relationshipps become strained. Rose has had a strained relationship sister Holly (Gillian Zinser) ever since their abusive mother (Dora Kiss) died from a drug overdose, and young Rose (Meghan Brown Pratt) discovered her body. Rose is invited to the birthday party of her nephew Jackson (Matthew Lamb) and has bought him a model train. But when Jackson opens his gift from Rose, it has somehow been placed by her dead cat, which had disappeared the night before, shocking him and the party guests. Humiliated, Rose is driven home by Trevor, but he cannot support her in her current mental state and becomes distant from her, insinuating that their engagement is off. Rose encounters an attendant smiling at her, convincing her she is now cursed. Desperate for answers, Rose visits her ex, Joel (Kyle Gallner), a police detective who responded to Laura's death. The two go through police records and find multiple cases where someone suffered supernatural hauntings before killing themselves while smiling. Rose visits the widow of Laura's professor, Victoria Munoz (Judy Reyes), posing as a reporter, she claims that her husband started acting differently after witnessing a woman die by suicide. Victoria soon realises Rose's identity and angrily orders her to leave. Going through further records, they find a link and a chain reaction with many victims passing the hauntings on to a witness, and these witnesses also commit apparent violent suicide. Joel discovers that none of the cursed victims have lived longer than a week. The only person to survive the curse is Robert Talley (Rob Morgan) who is in prison for killing a stranger. Rose and Joel visit Talley in prison, with Rose pretending that a patient of Rose's has been cursed. Talley explains that the only way to break the chain and escape the curse is to kill someone else, in front of a witness so that the curse will be transferred. Rose lets slip that she is the victim of this curse, and Talley panics and demands her to leave. Rose is visited by her therapist, Dr. Madeline Northcott (Robin Weigert), who has been visiting her to talk through her troubles; Northcott assumes it is suppressed trauma from the death of her mother. It turns out however that the demon has assumed the form of the therapist, smiling at her, attacking her, and telling her that it is ""almost time."" Rose visits Holly and tries to convince her of what is happening, but Holly does not believe it, and asks her to leave. Rose returns to the hospital, she has a vision of murdering Carl in front of Desai, who rips the skin off his face. Desai approaches her car and sees her erratic and holding a knife, he calls the police after she drives away in a panic. While Joel tries to track her down, Rose drives to her remote, abandoned former family home. Planning to deprive the demon of witnesses, Rose secludes herself in the house. The demon takes the form of her dead mother. It is revealed that Rose found her dying mother moments before she died from overdosing, she fearfully ignored her mother begging for help. Rose confronts the demon, who morphs into a tall, deformed creature. She sets the demon on fire with a lantern, seemingly killing it and ending the curse. As the house burns down, Rose drives to Joel's apartment and is comforted by him. But soon she realises the demon has taken his form. As she flees, Rose discovers that she is still at the old house, she hallucinated everything that happened from the moment she entered. As the real Joel arrives, Rose panics and goes back into the house, locking the door behind her. The demon overpowers Rose and rips off its face, revealing its true form as a skinless entity with a long grin, and it crawls into her mouth, possessing her. Joel enters the house and discovers Rose smiling and pouring gasoline over herself. Joel watches helplessly as a smiling Rose burns herself alive, passing the curse on to him. Also starring Perry Strong as Detective Buckley, Nick Arapoglou as Greg, Ura Yoana Sánchez as Nurse Wanda, Vanessa Cozart as Nurse, Kevin Keppy as Nightmare Mom, and Marti Matulis as The Monstruosity. Bacon gives an engaging lead performance, it is a simple story with similarities to The Ring (a curse lasting a week), the creepy supernatural atmosphere is effective, the jump scares work well, and the moments of violence are shocking, some critics complain it is clichéd, I personally found it a worthwhile psychological horror.

"This had the potential to be a really good horror movie. A patient commits suicide in a gruesome way in front of a counsellor in a mental hospital. The counsellor's suspicions are raised when it's discovered that the patient witnessed someone else killing themselves horribly too--clearly this 'thing' happening might be infectious. If that had been the main focus of the movie it would have been excellent, a sort of supernatural detective story. But it really wasn't. Sure, the counsellor discovers these links, but what does she do with this knowledge? Well, first she goes to tell her sister who actually has nothing to do with anything, and then she takes herself off a kind of chainsaw massacre cabin in the middle of nowhere ... this is one of those movies where if you took a drink every time someone does the very worst thing they could do in the circumstances, you'd be extremely drunk by the end of the film.The movie is not helped by very weak characterisation. We need to root for our main characters, don't we? Not be hoping they might kill themselves a bit earlier so they can stop being annoying. The lead character, the counsellor, is pretty mentally unstable before she gets dragged into these events. She's extremely unlikable--one of those people who shuts everyone out until she needs them then she's there begging for help and being obnoxious when its refused.I think there were men in this movie, but if there were they did nothing and contributed nothing.The ending was particularly frustrating. We discover that this entity can only be passed on by the witnessing of the current holder's suicide. A cop comes into the cabin where our protagonist has holed up, and she's finally about to kill herself. A really good writer would have had him shoot her before she could set herself alight. It would have been incredibly dramatic for his (up to then non-existent) character and a much more thought-provoking ending. Don't get too hooked on the smile part of any of this. It really didn't add much to the storyline except for the old body-distortion horror trope.This was so close to being a taut, interesting thriller/horror, but unfortunately it ended up being a 'don't go into the basement...oh, she did' sort of derivative film. Disappointing. But I'll admit to one superb jump scare. Wait for the bit when she's sitting in her car outside her sister's house .... hah. Don't be drinking tea when the sister comes out to confront her.",potential really good horror movie patient commits suicide gruesome way front counsellor mental hospital counsellor suspicion raised discovered patient witnessed someone else killing horribly clearly thing happening might infectious main focus movie would excellent sort supernatural detective story really sure counsellor discovers link knowledge well first go tell sister actually nothing anything take kind chainsaw massacre cabin middle nowhere one movie took drink every time someone worst thing could circumstance extremely drunk end film movie helped weak characterisation need root main character hoping might kill bit earlier stop annoying lead character counsellor pretty mentally unstable get dragged event extremely unlikable one people shuts everyone need begging help obnoxious refused think men movie nothing contributed nothing ending particularly frustrating discover entity passed witnessing current holder suicide cop come cabin protagonist holed finally kill really good writer would shoot could set alight would incredibly dramatic non existent character much thought provoking ending get hooked smile part really add much storyline except old body distortion horror trope close taut interesting thriller horror unfortunately ended go basement oh sort derivative film disappointing admit one superb jump scare wait bit sitting car outside sister house hah drinking tea sister come confront

"Sosiooe bacon plays rose, a pychiatrist leading a somewhat normal life. Until one day a young woman in her care talked about seeing a creature that smiles and she thinks it might be coming to kill her. She sadly kills herself in front of rose while having a manic smile. The smiles on the actors are the best part of the film. They are really and pretty creepy that adds. One from this rose goes in a spiral as she keeps thinking of her and the movie takes more of a tonal shift. I did like this film and thought it was done well.

"RESERVED FOR HORROR FANSA very good horror movie ,This is not only a deep dive into dealing with trauma and mental health but also a showcase of uncanny valley both in the plot and in the sound design and soundtrack. So much work went into triggering the audiences primal responses. Throughout the entire movie, we're being subconsciously triggered to feel like something is very wrong and we need to get away. Outstanding, symbolic cinematography also kept me on edge but also made me feel unhinged at the same time the characters were experiencing mental turmoil.

"This type of ending has to stop. What is the point of telling a story where you follow the protagonist on their journey only for them to go the mile, face up to their fears and demons (so to speak & literally), make amends in their past relationships, only for none of it to have done any good. That's not actually how life is. That's not indicative of the power of love and forgiveness and the human spirit. There are such things as demons and curses, and they can be overcome. What would be far more interesting would be a movie where that was legit accomplished. I hated the ending. Predictable and totally unsatisfying. Disappointing.That said, the movie had some interesting moments and given the abysmal state of horror, despite everything I've said it was above average.The demon looked pretty cool in some scenes.",type ending stop point telling story follow protagonist journey go mile face fear demon speak literally make amends past relationship none done good actually life indicative power love forgiveness human spirit thing demon curse overcome would far interesting would movie legit accomplished hated ending predictable totally unsatisfying disappointing said movie interesting moment given abysmal state horror despite everything said average demon looked pretty cool scene
"Overall not a bad movie. Creepy throughout with a lot of jump scares that kept me entertained. It definitely kept giving me vibes of 2002's The Ring, also a good movie. I was impressed with the entire cast. Sosie Bacon was phenomenal, and the supporting cast was fantastic including Robin Weigert who is excellent in everything she does. This movie kept me enthralled until....well, the ending..just flopped.

"I don't go in expecting a lot out of a horror movie. I just want to be entertained and maybe see something unexpected that unsettles or disturbs me in some way. For me, the smiles could have been a lot more wicked or evil or unnatural. Some of the scenes that shift rapidly though were good for the shock factor. I felt some of the same things I felt when I watched It Follows for the first time. I like that feeling of being disoriented and realizing the movie has entered an unsafe area where the normal rules of life no longer apply. Those are definite pluses. Good characters, good acting. I think the ending was somewhat predictable, but it was also satisfying. I would love a sequel or seven! I enjoyed it very much. I will watch it again.",go expecting lot horror movie want entertained maybe see something unexpected unsettles disturbs way smile could lot wicked evil unnatural scene shift rapidly though good shock factor felt thing felt watched follows first time like feeling disoriented realizing movie entered unsafe area normal rule life longer apply definite plus good character good acting think ending somewhat predictable also satisfying would love sequel seven enjoyed much watch
"It's rare to find a movie that checks all of the boxes you're looking for. Smile succeeds on so many levels - the acting, the dialogue, the sound, the cinematography, the building dread, the scares, and the payoff. It deftly uses the real life horror scenario of feeling powerless and alone to build tension, and has so many wonderful and earned in-movie jump scares (although many are more just actual scares) and then the third act hits you so hard that you nearly tear the theater armrests off for pure terror.Sosie Bacon is excellent as Rose, her descent into madness and fear is handled with precise care, and you really FEEL her emotional state. You get locked into the prison of solitude she feels, and it keeps you at the edge of your own sanity throughout the film. The rest of the cast is filled out with some other great performances from Caitlyn Stasey, Kyle Gallner, Robin Weigert, Kal Penn, Rob Morgan and Jack Sochet as Karl. Jessie T Usher is good too, but doesn't have quite as much to work with as he plays the straight laced boyfriend that serves as the mirror of society that Rose looks toward for help and doesn't get much in return from.The cinematography is creative and deliberate, and it builds a world that feels both familiar but also un-inviting, especially as the film progresses. The score is incredible, both the use of the music as well as the sound design to enhance the moments of dread as well as the scares.And without spoiling too much, the evil entity ends up being one of the most memorable and horrifying things in modern horror history!This is a must watch for horror and thriller fans!",rare find movie check box looking smile succeeds many level acting dialogue sound cinematography building dread scare payoff deftly us real life horror scenario feeling powerless alone build tension many wonderful earned movie jump scare although many actual scare third act hit hard nearly tear theater armrest pure terror sosie bacon excellent rose descent madness fear handled precise care really feel emotional state get locked prison solitude feel keep edge sanity throughout film rest cast filled great performance caitlyn stasey kyle gallner robin weigert kal penn rob morgan jack sochet karl jessie usher good quite much work play straight laced boyfriend serf mirror society rose look toward help get much return cinematography creative deliberate build world feel familiar also un inviting especially film progress score incredible use music well sound design enhance moment dread well scare without spoiling much evil entity end one memorable horrifying thing modern horror history must watch horror thriller fan

Far too many jumps, scares, and those moments when you think something is happening and it is just dreaming sequences.

"There are two kinds of jump scares: those that work and those that don't.This film has an awful lot of the former and I was (pleasantly) surprised, even a veteran horror fan, at how many times I jumped or felt the hairs on my arms stand up.Right from the start there is something not quite right with our lead character (Rose) she looks strange, ill and pasty, almost skeletal (sorry Sosie Bacon - I am sure it was the makeup)
Lots of little details pile up to give this film an unsettling aura.Like most horror movies when it starts to run out of steam it flounders pretty quicky - but this has the good sense to cut and run sharpish.I greatly enjoyed this but near the end I was overcome by a sense of inevitability that never left me.A very good effort.",two kind jump scare work film awful lot former pleasantly surprised even veteran horror fan many time jumped felt hair arm stand right start something quite right lead character rose look strange ill pasty almost skeletal sorry sosie bacon sure makeup lot little detail pile give film unsettling aura like horror movie start run steam flounder pretty quicky good sense cut run sharpish greatly enjoyed near end overcome sense inevitability never left good effort

"The scariest part of the movie are all of the jumpscares. Gets annoying. This movie was pretty good. Reminded me of the later 90s film Fallen with Denzel but slightly unique. In this case Instead of a demon being spread through touch, a person will witness a suicide and begin experiencing hallucinations and creepy situations until they ultimately perish in the same way, and so it goes on and on. Overall pretty original but I kept asking myself why she didnt do Denzels plan and just go into the isolated woods to end it. I thought Sosie was fantastic in this role and hope to see more of her in The future!",scariest part movie jumpscares get annoying movie pretty good reminded later film fallen denzel slightly unique case instead demon spread touch person witness suicide begin experiencing hallucination creepy situation ultimately perish way go overall pretty original kept asking didnt denzels plan go isolated wood end thought sosie fantastic role hope see future
"Creepily effective psychological horror that possibly relies a bit too much on jump scares - there are quite a few of them, and some work well But others don't, and their combined impact is somewhat dulled. What the film has in spades is creeping dread, relentless unease and genre literacy to burn meaning it's impossible to take your eyes off even if you want to. The central premise is a good one that nods to many other films, and if the it doesn't all quite hang perfectly together and the ending feels a bit forced and predictable, there's a lot here in writer-director's Parker Finn's feature debut to suggest he may be a talent to watch. Technically there's a lot to admire - camera choices, colour palettes, lighting, and more all combine to create the immersive and unsettling atmosphere. Good performances too - especially from lead Sosie Bacon and Kal Penn in an excellent supporting turn. The announcement of a sequel may be a mixed a blessing - a likely bigger budget and desire to outdo the original often kills creativity; but this is a promising, scary start to a director's career.",creepily effective psychological horror possibly relies bit much jump scare quite work well others combined impact somewhat dulled film spade creeping dread relentless unease genre literacy burn meaning impossible take eye even want central premise good one nod many film quite hang perfectly together ending feel bit forced predictable lot writer director parker finn feature debut suggest may talent watch technically lot admire camera choice colour palette lighting combine create immersive unsettling atmosphere good performance especially lead sosie bacon kal penn excellent supporting turn announcement sequel may mixed blessing likely bigger budget desire outdo original often kill creativity promising scary start director career

Turns out the shrink sees a shrink and has some child hood trauma to deal with. This all builds up into one hell of a good time.

"For context, I expected this to be a great movie so perhaps I fell for the hype and set the bar too high. Maybe I've seen one too many horror movies. The plot was generic and predictable, this was disappointing to me as it sometimes spoiled what could have been shocking moments. A couple jumpscares did get me and were fun, but more often than not they felt undeserved or underwhelming. There are some familiar faces in the cast, but I found myself recalling their prior work rather than appreciating their role in the movie. With all this in mind, my advice for anyone going to see this film is to have low expectations.

"Best horror movie since WHAT JOSIAH SAW. It tops every other horror movie of the last 2-3 years and that's a big praise, because there were some good horror movies recently ( I haven't watched PEARL).Originality in horror movies is a nearly impossible. However, this tried to be different and creative and i think it kinda succeed. It's very scary and intense for a non-desensitized horror fan. I am not a big fan of jump-scares but most of them are earned as another reviewer mentioned. There is not a single second wasted here, SMILE grabs you by the throat and doesn't leave you until the ending. There is dread, agony, anxiety. Actors did a good job but Sosie Bacon was even better, she was tremendous.This is a movie for a mature audience, there are no dumb/WTF moments here. I didn't love the last 15 minutes though. Not much subtlety. Up until the ending, there was too finesse here for a horror movie. There were some scenes that almost destroy the eerie atmosphere this movie created from the start.

"Smile is a well done, entertaining but typical horror. It excels at jump scares, of which there are many, some executed skillfully and others very predictable. This made for an overal good viewing, with decent tension, alright horror and decent acting.For pretty much a directorial debut for Finn this is a strong movie to start with. Horror is one of the easiest genre's and it doesn't innovate much, but it does work as a solid little horror movie. With well build tension. Some really good jump scares, the most notable one being the one where she just left her sister (trying to be vague here). That was the one that really got me, and was a bit silly too, but still scary. There are some dull scenes from a directing standpoint. The drone shots are nice but also don't do or say much.Acting was alright, I think the main actress is fantastic, no doubt. But the rest of the cast is kind of meh. This is also due to some of the dialog. I think her fianc√© was written well for the most part until it became a little too snobby towards the end. Her sister and friend are not great and the lines even worse. The therapist is good. And the girl at the start is good. Overall decent.Characters and story, if you've seen It Follows you've seen this movie too, so it's not very original, especially towards the finale which seems to mimic a scene from that movie almost directly, without the effect. But characters are kind of left behind, the fianc√©, the therapist, her sister. For a horror movie you'd expect more to actually happen. Daydreaming doesn't count. This did lower the stakes and tension a bit over time.Pacing, starts of strong, first 30 minutes are good, then it slouches a bit and for me it never really picked up fully again, it really slows down it's pace. This shouldn't have been a 2 hour movie.Gore and scares. Gore is pretty good, not excessive and not crazy real either (the cat was a bit off). Some of the CGI was iffy. But there's not that much gore anyways. Scares, the finale scare was a kind of funny looking one, not scary in the slightest, looked a bit cheap. The CGI scenes then were okay. The smile concept works for most actors, but not all. The final girl I think wasn't able to pull it off with her face. Whilst others were able to have that more disturbed look. That said as a concept I thought it worked, of course a bit silly, but also disturbing, which worked out.Score, sound design was great, really well done.

"I won't add a synopsis here as you can read that tagged to the title easy enough.The film uses scares well but jumps can be a little predictable, but.... That said, they are spaced and paced well, with use of the whole of the screen reminding me a little of It Follows. The film starts fairly slow and builds nicely.The music is good too and the overall gore builds continuously toward the end.

"And it all started so well. We really enjoyed the action, and there was lots of jumping and hiding behind cushions, plus a little gore; not to the dizzy heights of 'Saw', but enough. Frightening, but not horrendous. Not overly predictable either. Overall a really good basic horror movie that is in no way suitable for children.Sosie Bacon played her leading role as the psychiatrist/victim extremely well, and her make up was good too.

"Went into this with the confidence that I wouldn't be scared and could handle the jump scares. God damn I was wrong. Non stop frightening and eerie scenes which is very solid plot. Some parts of the movie were like 5 solid minutes of being on the edge of your seat. The jump scares are frequent with some being more unexpected than others. Also, a nice mix of trippy psychological thriller type scenes when you don't know what's real and what isn't.Literally had nightmares the night after seeing it and I'm generally ok with horror movies.Would definitely recommend seeing in the cinema for max effect.",went confidence scared could handle jump scare god damn wrong non stop frightening eerie scene solid plot part movie like solid minute edge seat jump scare frequent unexpected others also nice mix trippy psychological thriller type scene know real literally nightmare night seeing generally ok horror movie would definitely recommend seeing cinema max effect
"I liked it. It's a seriously creepy story with a fine, sinister atmosphere, it's chock-full of jump-scares, the special effects are convincing and it's pretty well acted, especially by Sosie Bacon, who the whole movie long has to act being out of her wits and on the brink of hysterical with fear.Towards the end it got a little too psychological for my taste, with Rose's feelings of guilt on account of her mother's suicide. And maybe the logic behind the goings-on wasn't that watertight, but hey, it's supernatural forces that we're talking about, so who cares for logic! If you like to be pleasantly and solidly scared for almost two hours, you will definitely find this one your money's worth!",liked seriously creepy story fine sinister atmosphere chock full jump scare special effect convincing pretty well acted especially sosie bacon whole movie long act wit brink hysterical fear towards end got little psychological taste rose feeling guilt account mother suicide maybe logic behind going watertight hey supernatural force talking care logic like pleasantly solidly scared almost two hour definitely find one money worth
"While Smile has quite a bit going for it is as well a run-of-a-mill horror film. Focusing on more of a psychological horror as opposed to a creature feature. It has suspense and mystery behind what goes on. However, though it is a rather slow movie the Entity itself does make quite a few appearances throughout. It doesn't have the intense presents as say It follows. Where you can never stop running. Here most of the time when it shows up it's almost more or less a jump scare and it gets tiresome after a while. The characters themselves are not all that interesting none of them stand out rather generic.",smile quite bit going well run mill horror film focusing psychological horror opposed creature feature suspense mystery behind go however though rather slow movie entity make quite appearance throughout intense present say follows never stop running time show almost le jump scare get tiresome character interesting none stand rather generic

"The sister, her husband, the fiance are all super annoying. It's like that with some horror movies. There is no single person in the movie who sympathizes with the main lead at all. The therapist who looks at her like some test subject. When you make a horror movie, include someone who abides by the main lead through her crises. It would be more enjoyable. The concept is alright. But it lacks any real depth. The scare factor lacks in much of the movie. There is no resolution either until the very end and even that is scarce. If the movie is about some entity, they should have expounded on it further. Figure out what is causing this. The history and root of the matter. I will give it a 4 because of the main lead and her acting. The screenplay and direction isn't done well either. Cinematography is not bad. I didn't get scared. It didn't shake me or move me. It was predictable all throughout. Where is the element of surprise? It was somewhat creepy but the characters are really unenjoyable. Terrible even.

"Rose saw her mother commit suicide when she was only ten, and it left a mark on her, and she becomes a doctor to try and help other distressed people. One day, after she was about to leave for the day, a patient is admitted and she goes to see her. The person is terrified, feels some evil entity has entered her, gives a sinister smile and commits suicide in a rather ghastly manner. This winds up unnerving her, but her concerns are taken for stress. She starts to investigate and it seems there is a pattern, and she is in it, which in itself is terrifying. The movie weaves real scenes and hallucinations nicely, to keep the audience off balance. Some scenes are upside down, perhaps a metaphor for the world being upside down. She searches for a pattern, and for an escape, as she feels her days are numbered.

"Smile is the first movie I've seen in a cinema after the March 2020 lockdowns. So I'm literally excited to watch any movie now in the cinemas.The movie explores traumatic experiences and how people are affected. A psychologist, Rose Cotter, works in a psychiatric hospital and witnesses a patient committing suicide in front of her. Soon, Rose begins to see things. Things that others cannot see.I love the cinematography and camera angles. The acting is great. Sosie Bacon, especially, did a fantastic job portraying a woman with a traumatic past.The movie started great. Often times it is also really scary. The great soundtrack adds more to the unsettling feel of the film. The climax and ending are ok, sometimes things can be very predictable. I was just a little disappointed with the ending. Oh well.I still recommend it, especially that it's Halloween.",smile first movie seen cinema march lockdown literally excited watch movie cinema movie explores traumatic experience people affected psychologist rose cotter work psychiatric hospital witness patient committing suicide front soon rose begin see thing thing others cannot see love cinematography camera angle acting great sosie bacon especially fantastic job portraying woman traumatic past movie started great often time also really scary great soundtrack add unsettling feel film climax ending ok sometimes thing predictable little disappointed ending oh well still recommend especially halloween
Very much like The Ring. If this came out 15-20 years ago it could have been a breakthrough horror movie. As it is it's mostly a rehash of other ideas that were executed better than this. Loud noises and sudden camera changes don't make up for the lack of depth or good writing. It could have been good. It suffers from too long of a runtime. The side characters are also not great and she had less than zero chemistry with her fianc√©.I have said everything I needed to say but now I have to write another 300 characters for some reason so here I am writing and keeping on writing to get to the limit.,much like ring came year ago could breakthrough horror movie mostly rehash idea executed better loud noise sudden camera change make lack depth good writing could good suffers long runtime side character also great le zero chemistry fianc said everything needed say write another character reason writing keeping writing get limit
"Really didn't fancy the look of this horror movie from the trailers, because I don't find people smiling scary at all. But I do like horror movies in general, and read the glowing reviews so gave it a chance.It's actually way better than I thought it would be, but also has the problems I thought it would have plus a couple more. On the positive side it is genuinely more scary than your average horror. But then Its also kind of dumb with the smiling stuff, with some of its attempts at being scary more laughable than spooky.It's also nothing original, and plays out like alot of better modern horror movies (such as ""It follows""). It could of still been scary enough to overcome the mediocre plot. If not for some stupid twists and a predictable ending making it swing back more toward the standard.",really fancy look horror movie trailer find people smiling scary like horror movie general read glowing review gave chance actually way better thought would also problem thought would plus couple positive side genuinely scary average horror also kind dumb smiling stuff attempt scary laughable spooky also nothing original play like alot better modern horror movie follows could still scary enough overcome mediocre plot stupid twist predictable ending making swing back toward standard
"Interesting idea, beautifully shot, well acted. Sosie Bacon (Kevin's daughter) is a standout. Caitlin Stasey likewise deserves special mention as the patient, Laura (recreating her role from the 2020 short, Laura Hasn't Slept). Much of the tension is stretched to breaking-point. At times you expect one thing but get another, at others you see exactly where it's heading and it still gets you. There's a strong feeling of 'this could happen in the real world'. The characters are believable, and some scenarios manage to be both cringe-inducing and shocking. However, it does feel derivative. The most common comparisons online are with The Ring and It Follows. It Follows is especially obvious, with the entity pursuing its victims whilst able to take on the appearance of anybody (a change from the original short), and one scene, the gigantic figure suddenly emerging from a darkened doorway, looks pretty much lifted wholesale. The supporting cast are good (although not everybody quite pulls off the 'creepy smile'; the best is Caitlin Stasey, used on the movie posters), and there are some effective jump scares.It starts to fall off in the last half hour or so; the reveal with the visiting psychotherapist, whilst initially well done, soon loses its power with one of those 'lesser' smiles and the (IMO) poor decision to have the entity speak with its own voice; the scenes in the old family home gave me Mama vibes (the house in the woods) but nowhere near as creepy, and I get the feeling they couldn't decide which ending they wanted so went with both of them (you'll see what I mean). But it's still entertaining.Apparently a sequel is on the way. 6.5/10.",interesting idea beautifully shot well acted sosie bacon kevin daughter standout caitlin stasey likewise deserves special mention patient laura recreating role short laura slept much tension stretched breaking point time expect one thing get another others see exactly heading still get strong feeling could happen real world character believable scenario manage cringe inducing shocking however feel derivative common comparison online ring follows follows especially obvious entity pursuing victim whilst able take appearance anybody change original short one scene gigantic figure suddenly emerging darkened doorway look pretty much lifted wholesale supporting cast good although everybody quite pull creepy smile best caitlin stasey used movie poster effective jump scare start fall last half hour reveal visiting psychotherapist whilst initially well done soon loses power one lesser smile imo poor decision entity speak voice scene old family home gave mama vibe house wood nowhere near creepy get feeling decide ending wanted went see mean still entertaining apparently sequel way
"Great study of a psychotic disorder and a progressing dissasociation from reality.Do not expect a horror here.At least not one of the kind you'd come expecting.By all means, it is a HORROR. The horror of a human brain going ape. The ghosts and manifestations can all be attributed to a sick mind, so I get it why people keep yammering about false promises. They want scares, they want poltergeists, blood and monsters. This movie, they get confused. But PTSD is like that. A brain can only take as much. One event can eff you up to the point you'll start seeing fairies. Protagonist here, traumatized in their childhood, witnessing an absolutely horryfing event, goes ""bonkers"". But boy, there are ghosts, aren't there? No, not really. This movie is not about supernatural stuff. Just a daily routine of a PTSD victim.

"""Smile"", written and directed by Parker Finn is a let-down. Trailers did their job well - movie looked interesting sort of in the model of ""Insidious"", however that movie was superior to this as it had a flowing story. Problems here are script development and direction. Many scenes and dialog feel terribly contrived and much of the interaction is aloof or unconvincing. Characters don't have interesting things to say, or dont have their own voices. Poor writing. Its a stodgy mess and disappointing. Sometimes being the director and writer of a movie may lead to inability to check problems in either execution or content of a movie, and this seems like the case.",smile written directed parker finn let trailer job well movie looked interesting sort model insidious however movie superior flowing story problem script development direction many scene dialog feel terribly contrived much interaction aloof unconvincing character interesting thing say dont voice poor writing stodgy mess disappointing sometimes director writer movie may lead inability check problem either execution content movie seems like case
Other movies have figured our intergenerational trauma and curses are a metaphorical match. This movie tries to pick up on that trope but seems to not have any real understanding of what can make this interesting. The story beats are hollow and generic. I found myself wanting the movie to end as it dragged on. The characters are cardboard cut outs. It's not terribly scary. There is a lot of unexplored territory and ideas for how this paranormal force might operate are barely glanced into.Curse seems to lack logic and we find our self in unearned and unexplained scenes (how did we decided to go back to this house?).,movie figured intergenerational trauma curse metaphorical match movie try pick trope seems real understanding make interesting story beat hollow generic found wanting movie end dragged character cardboard cut out terribly scary lot unexplored territory idea paranormal force might operate barely glanced curse seems lack logic find self unearned unexplained scene decided go back house
"When we first meet Dr. Rose Cotter, she's dressed strangely in slacks that are too short, big shoes, an ill-fitting blouse and seems so nervous, hyper, breathless and scattered that we could easily mistake her for a patient in the hospital where she works.As the movie progresses, her attire reflects her inner turmoil and fears so that she resembles a bag lady you might find in some alleyway. Ragged jeans, tattered tops, a wild disregard for her attire which may have been the point of her deteriorating wardrobe by director Parker Finn.Right at the beginning she encounters two very disturbed patients that she doesn't seem to be able to treat, with one of them ending up in a horrific situation. As the story progresses, we learn that there are ""smilers"" who can devastate our world. But who are they and why are they doing this?This VERY slow-moving story is technically well done: sharp photography, music, editing, acting. But you have to be in a certain mood to really stay with it to the end.I, for one, have never understood the boyfriends in these horror flicks who always stick with these highly neurotic heroines who often go off the deep end, leaping from their beds, shrieking, quivering, gasping and who never verbalize to these close companions what's bugging them.Now, that I've seen SMILE, i have no interest in re-watching it again but if you're looking for something just to fill up two hours of your free time, this might do the trick but as far as scares are involved, I've seen better.",first meet dr rose cotter dressed strangely slack short big shoe ill fitting blouse seems nervous hyper breathless scattered could easily mistake patient hospital work movie progress attire reflects inner turmoil fear resembles bag lady might find alleyway ragged jean tattered top wild disregard attire may point deteriorating wardrobe director parker finn right beginning encounter two disturbed patient seem able treat one ending horrific situation story progress learn smiler devastate world slow moving story technically well done sharp photography music editing acting certain mood really stay end one never understood boyfriend horror flick always stick highly neurotic heroine often go deep end leaping bed shrieking quivering gasping never verbalize close companion bugging seen smile interest watching looking something fill two hour free time might trick far scare involved seen better
"It would be misleading to suggest that Smile was simply influenced by prior horror films. Certain shots and concepts were lifted directly from the gorgeously original David Robert Mitchell film, It Follows (2014). Unlike that film, which features some of the most innovative work behind the camera in modern horror history, Parker Finn's camerawork was aggressively showy at times, and his overall direction played disingenuously. He was unmistakably trying to pass off this formulaic horror movie as some type of complex metaphor for overcoming past demons. The enveloping sound design, which worked well to create a frequently unsettling environment, was one of the film's few achievements worthy of praise. And while Sosie Bacon's performance was capable, she relied too heavily on over-exaggerated expressions of nervousness and was unable to shoulder the load of a trauma-centric film. The film's tone lacked a sense of impending terror, instead opting for a jump scare every ten minutes or so to keep you on edge. Don't get me wrong, jump scares can be exciting, but they only create a temporary anxiety that fades as soon as the scene is over. Incorporate an unsatisfying ending, and what you're left with is a below-average, cookie-cutter, slow-burn horror movie.",would misleading suggest smile simply influenced prior horror film certain shot concept lifted directly gorgeously original david robert mitchell film follows unlike film feature innovative work behind camera modern horror history parker finn camerawork aggressively showy time overall direction played disingenuously unmistakably trying pas formulaic horror movie type complex metaphor overcoming past demon enveloping sound design worked well create frequently unsettling environment one film achievement worthy praise sosie bacon performance capable relied heavily exaggerated expression nervousness unable shoulder load trauma centric film film tone lacked sense impending terror instead opting jump scare every ten minute keep edge get wrong jump scare exciting create temporary anxiety fade soon scene incorporate unsatisfying ending left average cookie cutter slow burn horror movie
"Smile is your standard horror movie with all the usual horror tropes that go along with this type of movie. It is a serviceable film held together by a great performance from Sosie Bacon.The movie relies on sound far too much, it is very much a quiet, quiet, bang! Type of film. By the end of it, i was getting numb to the constant loud banging.Smile has no originality to it and during it you will go, well that's like The Ring, that's from Blair Witch etc. And the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Smile has good suspense throughout the movie but once the CGI antagonist appears, the movie loses a lot of steam.It seems to be a case these days that every horror movie must have ridiculous CGI fire at some point in the final third.Smile was built upon an outstanding marketing campaign and has done amazing box office numbers. The movie does enough to warrant a pass from the majority.(There really should have been a lot more scary smiley faces throughout the film).",smile standard horror movie usual horror trope go along type movie serviceable film held together great performance sosie bacon movie relies sound far much much quiet quiet bang type film end getting numb constant loud banging smile originality go well like ring blair witch etc ending leaf lot desired smile good suspense throughout movie cgi antagonist appears movie loses lot steam seems case day every horror movie must ridiculous cgi fire point final third smile built upon outstanding marketing campaign done amazing box office number movie enough warrant pas majority really lot scary smiley face throughout film

"I have been watching horror films all my life and my earliest one was Poltergeist(1982). Since then I've watched through the golden age of Hollywood horror movies. Face the facts, the Hollywood film industry is dead. The reason being lack of talented actors and script writers. We have had actors in the past the likes of Burt Lancaster, Charlton Heston, Sean Connery, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Roger Moore, Richard Burton, Kirk Douglas and many, many more legends. These actors had ""personality"". You were immediately drawn to them. You also had legendary script writers such as Mario Puzo, Steven E. De Souza, Dan O'Bannon, Oliver Stone, Jim And John Thomas, James Cameron, Stanley Kubrick, Harold Ramis, and David Mamet.Nowadays, you have none of the likes of the ones mentioned above. Thus the film industry is suffering from a lack of ideas as well. This movie Smile is about a curse passed on from person to person like a virus. There are elements of paranormal as well. If you've seen movies from The Grudge and The Ring horror franchise, both original Japanese and American remakes, then do yourself a favor and skip watching this film. The intention of writing the review is to tell you that the American Horror film industry is dead. There will be no more good horror movies the likes of the 70's, 80's and 90's. The 90's marked the end of Hollywood. In 1996 there was a strong attempt a resurgence with movies like
Independence Day, Twister, Mission Impossible and The Rock. But it was a false trigger. This was the last good offering before the demise.Smile is a movie with little to no forethought and afterthought. We all know from The Grudge and The Ring movies how a curse works. So with this new entry, people already know what to expect. Sophie Bacon is a talent-less actress. Her father Kevin Bacon rose to fame with a cult horror film called Tremors and starred in another good movie I like called Stir Of Echoes. He also played the role of the invisible man in the Paul Verhoeven(directed the first Robocop movie) film Hollow Man.In the movie Smile, the main plot element is the curse. The rest of the film deals with the origin of the curse and how and if possible, the curse can be stopped permanently. The most notable actor in the movie is Kal Penn who is famous for playing Kumar Patel in the Harold & Kumar film series. His acting in the film is okay. This is another actor who has aged badly. The rest of the cast is abysmal. Parker Finn's directorial debut is a disaster by my high standards.The photography, sound-effects and editing is decent. The flaw is in the script. The director should have seen it and rectified it, but he didn't and I had to suffer watching two hours worth of nonsense.Verdict: I do not recommend you see the movie. See horror movies of past years that you have missed. Make a collection of your favorite movies and keep watching them again and again. Thanks for reading this review.Some cult horror movies: Suspiria 1977, Inferno 1980, The Changeling 1980, The Evil Dead 1981, Wolfen 1981, Lifeforce 1985, Silver Bullet 1985, The Stuff 1985, Phenomena 1985, Cat's Eyes 1985, Fright Night 1985, The Hitcher 1986, From Beyond 1986, Hellraiser 1987, Prince Of Darkness 1987, The Gate 1987, The Monster Squad 1987, The Blob 1988, Killer Klowns From Outer Space 1988, The Woman in Black 1989. There are too many movies here to write them all, this is a good guide and starting point for newbie horror fans. And here's an exception thought The Exorcist is considered the greatest atmospheric horror movie ever made about demonic possession, its sequel Exorcist 2 The Heretic was poorly received. I have seen it and it is a worthy film for me filled with awesome photography and background music and it has Sir Richard Burton in it.

"I was ready to give this movie a 10/10 of ten because it was very engaging, but then, to my sheer, genuine horror, the last 15 minutes almost destroyed it completely.It was painfully frustrating to see a solid, atmospheric thriller suddenly imploding. The premise is VERY interesting and the tension almost becomes unbearable right up until the finale, when suddenly the worst cliches were all over the place and had me shaking my head in disbelief instead of holding my breath, like I did for the previous 100 minutes.It's definitely worth watching, but I wish there would be an alternate ending released at some point. It's very hard to believe that they came up with such a silly, unoriginal and worst of all unsatisfying ending to this smart, engaging horror story, carried by a great performance from the leading actress.",ready give movie ten engaging sheer genuine horror last minute almost destroyed completely painfully frustrating see solid atmospheric thriller suddenly imploding premise interesting tension almost becomes unbearable right finale suddenly worst cliche place shaking head disbelief instead holding breath like previous minute definitely worth watching wish would alternate ending released point hard believe came silly unoriginal worst unsatisfying ending smart engaging horror story carried great performance leading actress
"As I've learned with Truth Or Dare, smiles are never as creepy on film as they are in a scary story. I've heard enough horror podcast to know the eerie feeling I get when I hear of a creepy smile then actually seeing one.This film has a worthy protagonist, someone you can kinda root for and some definitely decent jump scares but outside of that it's not much to talk about.This film is kind of like The Happening with smiles. Over the top suicides with a smirk. It has a better message (i think) with commentary on trauma but in the end it's just an ok horror and thats a lot better than what we've been getting so I'm good with that.",learned truth dare smile never creepy film scary story heard enough horror podcast know eerie feeling get hear creepy smile actually seeing one film worthy protagonist someone kinda root definitely decent jump scare outside much talk film kind like happening smile top suicide smirk better message think commentary trauma end ok horror thats lot better getting good
"First of all, thanks to Parker Finn and Susie Bacon and all the wonderful casts who smiled!I am a screenwriter and I know that most of the time when the writer and director are the same person, we have a wonderful work because the screenwriter is the first person who sees the film in his mind before the cameras come!And like a mother who can raise her child better than anyone else, the writer can make the film better than anyone else if it has a motherly feeling towards the film.Making a good horror film, which I believe is the most difficult genre of cinema, is really sensitive and difficult because the viewer does not get scared easily!And this is the reason why we don't give high rate to horror movies because they can't scare us mentally and be real at the same time.In my opinion, a horror movie should occupy your mind for at least a week or maybe a lifetime!I have watched Smile 3 times and I must say it is a solid horror movie with a good and fast storyline
It has a wonderful cast
It has a wonderful direction
It has a wonderful editing by Eliot Greenberg
And the masterful cinematography by Charlie Saroff.The combination of colors in this movie is very beautiful, the rotation of the camera and the light radiation and the sound combination are really artI gave it 9 out of 10 and I could have given it 10, but the one point I didn't give is because when Suzy Bacon plays the wonderful mental breakdown scenes in close-up, the music works poorly.I think this movie would be complete with a melancholic music.Watch and enjoy

"I just finished watching the movie, I have to admit it's a generic horror but it has elements that I love. A mixture of fear and madness. I loved the fact that the scary moments begin after only 20 minutes of film. This film managed to keep me glued to the screen until the end and for every moment I had that generic horror thrill. I advise all horror lovers to watch it if you don't know what to do in an evening. My review is 8 out of 10 stars, I loved having real mind trips while watching the movie. I watched this film on chili paying only 4 euros for the HD version, I recommend it to everyone.",finished watching movie admit generic horror element love mixture fear madness loved fact scary moment begin minute film film managed keep glued screen end every moment generic horror thrill advise horror lover watch know evening review star loved real mind trip watching movie watched film chili paying euro hd version recommend everyone
"I've never given a movie a 10 so a 7 for me is a good movie, not just in terms of value but was I entertained. I can honestly say that this was the most entertaining horror movie I've seen for quite a while. That is in some ways because most of the crap that has been produced lately is such garbage, but I still would have enjoyed this movie even in a year with really good horror movies.FYI: I had surgery recently and was on pain killers when I viewed this which often makes me lose focus and it kept my attention the whole time. LOL.Acting was good, and while others drew comparisons to other movies, I did not think it was formulaic or a copy. It stands on it's own for me and I would recommend it to friends.",never given movie good movie term value entertained honestly say entertaining horror movie seen quite way crap produced lately garbage still would enjoyed movie even year really good horror movie fyi surgery recently pain killer viewed often make lose focus kept attention whole time lol acting good others drew comparison movie think formulaic copy stand would recommend friend

But I am doing it anyway with a view to saving more people's time and not letting it go to waste by watching this inconsequential movie in the horror genre. The audacity of the makers to make something as half baked as this!Just forget everything and just don't waste your time. Don't even watch this out of curiosity.

"Admittedly, this story features highlights from other plots. It was interesting enough to keep my family entertained & not feel cheated. There's a lot of reviewers here that are quite cynical enough to say it's unworthy. Idk, if you like scary & can turn your brain off for a while, this is a good one. I will definitely remember this one over the tons of other possibly more original stories bc of some of the gripping scenes & imagery. Felt like the best sense of foreboding with characters seen and unseen was not fully leveraged. C'est la vie! This is supposedly to be enjoyable, so watch and enjoy.

"When I've first heard of this movie I thought it will be a thriller not much of a horror but when I see it this film completely change my expectations and rise above it. I mean what an amazing horror flick it'll give you thrilling moments throughout the film but this should be called as a proper horror. Director has given a new take on this film with different camera angles, edge of a seat screenplay and satisfied climax. Simple story not much of a complication but the scare that this movie will give you it's just come out of nowhere. Infact some scenes are so unpredictable that you just gonna think what's just happened. Clever writing by the writer and perfect direction. I hope this film has a 2nd installment too because I'll be very much excited to see where it ends.

"I liked how they created a chilling and scary scenes mixed with good jump scares, even though you can see most of them coming. They took a close up shoots on the main character every time her condition gotten worse and this is giving a good depth to know the situation of the character.But, I wished they put so much efforts in many aspects of the movie. I think many characters got wasted in the middle of the movie, such as the husband and the therapist, they just vanished from the plot. If you wanted to take them out, I wished you did it in a way that will help the plot at least.The ending was so bad, I think the writers got stuck by how he can end the curse. So he gave us an open ending leading to part two. There are many unanswered questions that should be answered. It is not clear that they're facing demons and curses or just a mental illness.We'll see when they will announce part two of it.",liked created chilling scary scene mixed good jump scare even though see coming took close shoot main character every time condition gotten worse giving good depth know situation character wished put much effort many aspect movie think many character got wasted middle movie husband therapist vanished plot wanted take wished way help plot least ending bad think writer got stuck end curse gave u open ending leading part two many unanswered question answered clear facing demon curse mental illness see announce part two
I dont scare easily. In fact i dont think ive watched a movie thats really scared me in about 7 years. But this movie genuinely freaked me out. I was uneasy throughout much of the show. The story is also intruiging enough to actually care about. Not to mention the whole thing is a cool symbol for real world horrors.Which is where the problem is.This movie actually could have been good. There could have been actually something of substance here. The curse in this film is likened to trauma. Which is pretty neat and creative. But by the end of the film they really throwaway any notion of substance (by the ending) and its pretty frustrating. Because they could have done something great.,dont scare easily fact dont think ive watched movie thats really scared year movie genuinely freaked uneasy throughout much show story also intruiging enough actually care mention whole thing cool symbol real world horror problem movie actually could good could actually something substance curse film likened trauma pretty neat creative end film really throwaway notion substance ending pretty frustrating could done something great
"This was sorely disappointing and it had a horrible ending. The psychosis factor was pretty intriguing but they dropped the bottom out on this at the end. Not the best horror of the year and for the hype, very disappointing.I think that Rose's acting was the best part and the delivery of belief of fear was pretty on point, but for the summarization of how it came together there was something lacking and I think that there's a lot that can be said for how quickly rushed the visual aide for the entity came in. I understand it was meant to shock factor things, but I also didn't feel like it brought everything together in an effective way. There were people booing the ending in the theater.",sorely disappointing horrible ending psychosis factor pretty intriguing dropped bottom end best horror year hype disappointing think rose acting best part delivery belief fear pretty point summarization came together something lacking think lot said quickly rushed visual aide entity came understand meant shock factor thing also feel like brought everything together effective way people booing ending theater

"I have seen A LOT of horror movies as a horror enthusiast. This movie is definitely not one of the bad ones. I haven't written a review in a LONG TIME, but felt compelled to write a review on this movie because of all the horrors I've seen, which is hundreds possibly thousands, and not many creep me out or have me on edge. This movie had the right mix of shock factor, suspense, tension built into scenes, unsettling, not knowing what's real and what's not, mystery, you name it, to make it a great horror movie. There is room for improvement and some things that the biggest critic will question like some of actions/decisions of the main star, but on a whole, this movie is definitely worth a watch and isn't deserving of low reviews!

I truied to watch it by myself the first time, getting about 40 minutes into it before I had to stop and get my wife to watch it with me. Sorry, I know that sounds awful, but I don't like being in a big lonely house watching scary movies alone.So, I got my wife to watch the movie with me, she was also scared, ane at the same parts, so I didn't feel bad. It's got a good storyline, but it's not a surprise in the end. Stays pretty much to the scary movie ABC's. You could probably skip the end so you don't get disappointed at the lazy writing.

I went in with low expectations. Thought it was going to be another low budget horror film. Boy was I wrong. It was beautifully shot. The cinematography was outstanding. The score made me feel uneasy which went hand in hand with the subject matter of the film. It touched on mental health & stigmas behind it (comments made by law enforcement/partner not being supportive). One of the main subjects being suicide already makes it for it to be an uneasy movie to watch but then you add the paranormal/horror aspect of it & it makes it for an unsettling watch. The acting was superb from the leading actress.

"I recently watched the brand new horror movie Smile and absolutely loved it. Quite a treat to see a horror with an original story. Yes the smile that adorns the faces of the patients is reminiscent of the movie Truth or Dare, but in this context it's used to it's full advantage. It's a rare thing these days to actually sit in a cinema and people jump in reaction at the events unfolding before them. All in all the story, a psychiatrist finds herself centre stage in a myriad of situations where seeing isn't always believing, has a 70's feeling to it. The jump shocks are regular throughout the movie and even i, as someone who is a total horror geek, couldn't see the end coming. Definitely 10 out of 10.",recently watched brand new horror movie smile absolutely loved quite treat see horror original story yes smile adorns face patient reminiscent movie truth dare context used full advantage rare thing day actually sit cinema people jump reaction event unfolding story psychiatrist find centre stage myriad situation seeing always believing feeling jump shock regular throughout movie even someone total horror geek see end coming definitely

"The plot is weak. There aren't many scares other than the 'jump' kind. The characters, for the most part, are not that likeable. More often than not the 'smiles' that are supposed to be terrifying come off as goofy. It's going to be tough to meet the IMDB quota for 600 characters because there's not much here.It was nice to see Robin Weigert who I LOVED as Calamity Jane on 'Deadwood' but she's not given a lot to do. That's the same for the entire cast.They spend the entire film going back and forth between whether what the protagonist is experiencing is real or the result of childhood trauma and guilt. You get the idea that the movie is really headed somewhere and there was a good opportunity to turn this into an 'elevated' horror film but it really tanks in the third act. 'It Follows' covers a lot of the same ground and does it MUCH better.It's not a horrible movie but there's not much here to command your attention. It's a good movie to put on while you're doing other stuff.",plot weak many scare jump kind character part likeable often smile supposed terrifying come goofy going tough meet imdb quota character much nice see robin weigert loved calamity jane deadwood given lot entire cast spend entire film going back forth whether protagonist experiencing real result childhood trauma guilt get idea movie really headed somewhere good opportunity turn elevated horror film really tank third act follows cover lot ground much better horrible movie much command attention good movie put stuff
Was intrigued to watch and from the first death but hated the music choice etc This film is basically another version of the film IT FOLLOWS they even used the same indie film music through out. This choice of sounds is so overused now and to be quite frank does not make the film scary or intense just boring and dreary. Want to make a blockbuster movie?! Tip come up with blockbuster scores for backing music.. The cop was the most interesting thing to watch. His acting was flawless and above a indie feeling movie and im sure the lead ladys acting was too. The rest of the cast were just bleugh!!! Unnatural actors and horrible personality side characters. None of the jumpscares worked and the cat thing was in poor taste and made no sense as I'm assuming the entity is incorporeal until it can possess who its stalking. Ending was lame.

What a waste of time. Once again I fell for the hype and thought I might actually see a decent horror movie. Was I ever wrong. There were more laughs in this movie than actual scares. Every scene was predictable. The cuts were very amateurish and special effects were definitely nothing to write home about. It was all I could do to stay awake. I'm so surprised that some of these reviews actually think this movie is scary. It makes me sad to think what a low threshold they must have. If you want to see a scary movie go back and watch a rerun of jaws. Or Night of the living Dead this movie is more comedy than horror movie. Save your money.

Is the acting good? Meh.... you get my point. Everything in this movie has been done before and better. I will give them props for 1 specific jump scare, that was unique and done exceptionally well.

"Definitely preferred this horror curse storyline over The Ring (2002) and It Follows (2014). The jump scares were solid and many scenes were unnerving, but also some were easily predicted and obvious before they materialized on-screen. All the smiling people were creepy as hell, especially in that opening scene with the psychiatric patient. Sosie Bacon is impressive as the lead and really makes us viewers feel for her and the trauma she experiences through the film. The ending is terrifying and also refreshing to see a recent horror film deliver a tragic, unhappy, realistic ending where the main character doesn't beat the demonic entity tormenting her.

She works for Dr. Morgan Desai (Kal Penn). She gets a call on a new patient Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey). Laura was studying for her PhD at the local university when she witnessed the sinister smiling professor bludgeon himself to death with a claw hammer.

"Actually, the IMDB community is quite hardened and knows every gag and every creepy secret. Strangely enough, lately there are reviews that are too good. Like the one for Smile. What, pray tell, is new, different or just good about this film? Everyone knows that if someone goes into a house with an open fire, it will burn down. Everyone knows that if the camera shows a dark room, that evil is already behind you. There are far too many scenes like this and after a half hour that starts out quite decent, the film gets worse and worse and more and more transparent. Even the lead actress has few ideas to add to this crude nonsense.

"When I saw this film advertised I figured it would be like a dozen other films with a similar plot (The Ring, The Grudge, Countdown, It Follows etc). Whilst it is similar, it does manage to stand apart from some by focusing heavily on mental health, but it's hardly original.Side note, the marketing for this film was amazing and they promoted it in such a clever way.Smile follows the same storyline as most of this type of film: Event happens, entity attaches itself to the lead, the lead unravels whilst investigating, as time runs out the lead must find a way to break the curse or die themselves.Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick's daughter Sosie Bacon and her giant cheek mole do a good job as the lead and capture the unraveling state of someone in constant anxiety well.There are some good jump scares and the tone of the film is extremely quiet and creepy throughout. The cinematography is good and it really keeps you on edge the way that it's filmed.Bit of an anticlimactic end in my opinion, but overall good.",saw film advertised figured would like dozen film similar plot ring grudge countdown follows etc whilst similar manage stand apart focusing heavily mental health hardly original side note marketing film amazing promoted clever way smile follows storyline type film event happens entity attache lead lead unravels whilst investigating time run lead must find way break curse die kevin bacon kyra sedgwick daughter sosie bacon giant cheek mole good job lead capture unraveling state someone constant anxiety well good jump scare tone film extremely quiet creepy throughout cinematography good really keep edge way filmed bit anticlimactic end opinion overall good
"There isn't a film that builds suspense through its shots as well as this that's been produced in some years. It's astonishing to me that lame movies like X get lauded as great horror and this doesn't. This movie was so unsettling in its movement and framing and use of music. The interspersing of jump scares and slow moving dread. I came into this thinking it wouldn't be a sustainable concept for a 2 hour film. A smiling thing that kills people. Like, eventually the smiling stuff would get old and i wouldn't care. But they do it so appropriately and uniquely. It's a masterclass in timing and pacing. The birthday scene is actually perfect. Not in some exaggerated ""dang bro that was perf"", but there isn't a single second within that 10 minutes or so that could've been used differently. It's not the greatest horror film ever. However, with our current horror landscape, it rivals Hereditary, and stands alone in its style.",film build suspense shot well produced year astonishing lame movie like x get lauded great horror movie unsettling movement framing use music interspersing jump scare slow moving dread came thinking sustainable concept hour film smiling thing kill people like eventually smiling stuff would get old care appropriately uniquely masterclass timing pacing birthday scene actually perfect exaggerated dang bro perf single second within minute could used differently greatest horror film ever however current horror landscape rival hereditary stand alone style

"Excellent opening that sets everything up very clearly. The jump scares are executed so well and they're nowhere near as easy to do as haters think. It's not just a loud sound... you have to build tension beforehand, misdirect the audience, and have a great creepy sound (not just any loud sound will work) but the correct timing is very important. Even Jaws and The Thing have jump scares so we shouldn't just hate on jump scares. I guess I understand the hate on fake jump scares like a black cat for example, which is too much of a cliche that I would also hate but this film doesn't have any silly cats and I think they really deserve a ton of credit. The mystery is very involving and I was so happy to see the monster at the end. It looked amazing, a perfect blend of practical and CGI. Sure, Smile does borrow heavily from It Follows but I love that film too and I would still counter that this movie forges its own path.

"But as a horror movie, it simply does not cut it. No matter how the director's intentions of building up an eerie atmosphere, with jump scares dispatched here and there, sounds effects, gore and unusual camerawork were. The movie was silly, and unable to be scary. Like I've already stated from other ¬´ modern ¬ª horror, they call ¬´ elevated ¬ª to be trendier, the melodrama is the only aspect giving justice to the lazy script. I lost it during the birthday party, with the dead cat in the box, the heroine falling backwards on the glass table. And trying to choke herself with her necklace. The horror is where you begin laughing at the movie, I thought. And some of the over the top acting didn't help making it more serious. Sosie Bacon is a good lead, but she has absolutely no chemistry with the actor playing her fianc√©. I even thought Rose was single, and it could've worked either way. And one that is through the roof with Kyle Gallner's character, that's revealed to be her ex, one hour and a half into the movie... To me it lost its way and effectiveness with too many detours and quotas. So even without not being good at horror, it's still is too flawed to justify the hype of the time of its release. Even the ending is so predictable, you wish they didn't chose to go the franchise route at the last minute, by assuming this mediocre first entry was good enough to spawn a movie series.

"The first girl's smile was terrifying and I was super hyped. The lead actress was also very convincing and the premise was being setup nicely, though a bit predictably . Midway into the movie, you figure out what's going to happen and it happens exactly the same way. This could have been an excellent horror but it becomes another ""typical"" horror movie.I was really hoping I was wrong but the movie never turns it back around and ended pretty much how one can easily predict.

"Surprisingly ok, considering that from the trailers it looks a bit bad and goofy, but it really surprised my expectations and it was really a serious film based a lot on trauma and its effects. There are many scary scenes done well, even if we have the clich√©s that appear in every horror movie, the fact that you don't know what is real and what isn't in some moments has a very good effect. Unfortunately, the ending is quite disappointing, not too bad, but I was expecting something different and I'm sure it could have been much better, but it ends again like in any other horror movie.

"Another dumb, no substance ""scary"" movie that scares you by loud sounds and pop up ghosts. Storyline is boring and the only ""scary"" part is the loud sounds they use to create suspense.

"I guess I am the minority, this was a bit meh for me. Along with The Black Phone, I haven't enjoyed this years horror releases. I am now wondering whether it is worth watching The Barbarian. There were a few jump scares in this but compared to Sinister, which was brilliant, this film left me wondering how they filled 2 hours. There is a film called ""Unsane"" which is much better than this, didn't get half as much attention and was even filmed on an iPhone. Clever marketing I guess with placement of people with the creepy smile in prominent areas. I feel like the idea would have worked as the original short film but not a 2 hour feature length offering.",guess minority bit meh along black phone enjoyed year horror release wondering whether worth watching barbarian jump scare compared sinister brilliant film left wondering filled hour film called unsane much better get half much attention even filmed iphone clever marketing guess placement people creepy smile prominent area feel like idea would worked original short film hour feature length offering
"It's hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies, especially since ""It follows"" is freakier and it has an amazing score.If you haven't seen the movie I'm referring to, it is basically the same plot. ""Smile"" might seem like a creative and original film , but it just isn't. In fact, I would have probably rated the movie higher if I had never come across ""It Follows"", unfortunately having the knowledge that there is a similar movie that came out almost a decade ago that did it better makes it hard for me to rate this one higher. I know not everyone feels that way about ""It follows"" , it was more of one of those cult classics that could have been a major miss for some, but I absolutely loved it.""Smile"" is fine and I can see why ppl like it, but all this movie is doing for me is making me want to go watch ""It Follows"" again.",hard ignore similarity two movie especially since follows freakier amazing score seen movie referring basically plot smile might seem like creative original film fact would probably rated movie higher never come across follows unfortunately knowledge similar movie came almost decade ago better make hard rate one higher know everyone feel way follows one cult classic could major miss absolutely loved smile fine see ppl like movie making want go watch follows
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Smile"" (2022) was an excellent horror movie. I liked it very much. Being a horror fan i was looking forward to it after hearing positive things, and it did not disappoint so say the least. Story was good and kind of unique. I love these concepts in horror movies. Writing and directing as well as acting were superb - at running time almost 2 hours never was it boring or involving. Also horror stuff was first rate - it literally gave me goosebumps and usually i don't get scared easily.Overall, ""Smile"" was a truly excellent, creepy and scary horror movie.

"Horror Season is upon us and SMILE has kicked it off for me with a bang, or better yet, a smile.I went into this blind which is the best way as I've seen the final shot of the trailer and it gives away one of the best scares in the film. From the poster it looked as if it could be cheesy B level horror but it was nothing of the sought.Smile is a Horror/Psychological Horror with sub themes of trauma and suicide. The best part of the film was the direction and cinematography from debut director Parker Finn. He utilised so many great shots which made the entire film feel claustrophobic and tense. There are a good number of jump scares but the film keeps you on edge even without them. Outside of the direction, the acting is strong as is the sound design/score which helps elevate many of the tense moments.I would recommended if you are interested in psychological/curse horror thrillers.",horror season upon u smile kicked bang better yet smile went blind best way seen final shot trailer give away one best scare film poster looked could cheesy b level horror nothing sought smile horror psychological horror sub theme trauma suicide best part film direction cinematography debut director parker finn utilised many great shot made entire film feel claustrophobic tense good number jump scare film keep edge even without outside direction acting strong sound design score help elevate many tense moment would recommended interested psychological curse horror thriller
"So, what we have here is a movie about a woman who is descending into madness.""Smile"" centers on Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) who witness is one of her patients who she had just met 10 minutes prior committing suicide while smiling. This then throws her into said world of is this real, am I being haunted, who can I trust.The way that she is descended into madness is that there is a unknown entity that latches onto its victims, causing them to kill themselves in front of other people, and then the entity latches itself onto the person who has Witnessed this suicide. The whole time that they do this suicide they are smiling. While they are being stalked and terrorized by this evil entity, they are approached by smiling people which are not actually real.Sounds pretty bland, but, it's very entertaining and, although I felt that the gags were getting a little bit old. For instance, you're not quite sure if what what is really helpful and what isn't. I understand. That is the intention of the directors, but, whenever it's literally everything that's involved in the movie, it does get a little tiresome.There were some fantastic gags, and, all the acting was superb.

"I'm going to be using The Titanic as a metaphor becuase it seemed fitting. Talk about wasted potential, this film starts out farily strong building a back story to our protagonist and even showing that she's trying to help people in need. A bit generic but I've seen worse. And the suspense builds till around the half way point. Here's where we see the iceberg, when they try to explain the lore behind ""the curse"" it seems like the writers were reaching and by that I mean they used other films as ""inspiration"". But our ship doesn't hit the iceberg till our protagonist finds out how to get rid of said ""curse"". She needs to kill someone, which she says she can't do and ten minutes later she's got a knife driving full speed to a hospital. Okay, why? Off all the places she could go why go to where you work? Let's overlook that a loving character just made a U turn and is the soul responsible for all those who drowned aboard the Titanic. See how the metaphor fits... The boyfriend and fiance feel like they were shoehorned into the film and added as much weight to it as a paperclip.I genuinely feel sorry for Parker Finn and mostly for Sosie Bacon who tried despertaly to keep this film afloat, but the writers were like no, we need to make this as ludicrous as possible.

"Horror puts on a merrily sinister face with ""Smile"", Parker Finn's directorial debut. The movie's overarching theme is trauma and repressed memories. Neither of which subtract from the horror factor. One scene in particular made me nearly jump out of my skin (it probably added to this feeling that the one other person in the theater was a woman a few rows behind me softly talking to herself to the point where she seemed like a character in the movie).All in all, it's one of the intensest movies out there. The star is Sosie Bacon (daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, she co-starred on ""Mare of Easttown""). You'll never look at happy faces the same way again after watching this.In conclusion, to riff on a certain Shirley Temple movie that I only know because a clip got used in ""Myra Breckinridge"", you've got to S-M-I-L-E to be S-C-A-R-Y.",horror put merrily sinister face smile parker finn directorial debut movie overarching theme trauma repressed memory neither subtract horror factor one scene particular made nearly jump skin probably added feeling one person theater woman row behind softly talking point seemed like character movie one intensest movie star sosie bacon daughter kevin bacon kyra sedgwick co starred mare easttown never look happy face way watching conclusion riff certain shirley temple movie know clip got used myra breckinridge got l e c r
"If it weren't for Trevor (Jesse Usher). Who ever told him he could act????? There was no chemistry between him and any of the other characters at all. It was like he wandered into the wrong movie set and they just forced him to stay there. Even so, he delivery of his lines were robotic and monochromatic, even when they weren't supposed to be. Even the cat had more character. Other than that, it was a really good movie. Very creepy, suspenseful and eerie. Jump scares were few but very well placed, it relied heavily on the music and facial expressions. Ms. Bacon is a fantastic actress and has a very bright future.

"When the horror histories of the 2010s are written, the decade will be associated with trauma metaphors the way the '80s are with slasher movies. And although it comes on the cusp of a new decade, the new Paramount wide-release horror movie ""Smile"" fits right in with its PTSD-induced kin. The difference here is that the monster is barely a metaphor at all: The demon, or evil spirit, or whatever it is-the movie is vague on this point-literally feeds on, and is spread by, trauma. ""Smile"" likes the taste of people who have witnessed someone else dying by suicide-gruesome, painful, bloody suicide, by garden shears and oncoming trains and the shattered fragments of a ceramic vase in a hospital intake room. That's where Rose briefly meets Laura (Caitlin Stasey), a PhD student who's brought to the psychiatric emergency ward where Rose works, shaking and terrified that something is out to get her. ""It looks like people, but it's not a person,"" Laura explains, saying that this thing has been following her ever since she witnessed one of her professors bludgeoning himself to death with a hammer four days earlier. At the end of the extended dialogue scene that opens the film, Laura turns to Rose with a psychotic grin on her face and proceeds to slit her own throat. ""Smile's"" greatest asset is its relentless, oppressive grimness: This is a film where children and pets are as vulnerable as adults, and the horror elements are bloody and disturbing to match the dark themes. This unsparing sensibility is enhanced by Bacon's shaky, vulnerable performance as Rose: At one point, she screams at Trevor, ""I am not crazy!,"" then mumbles an apology and looks down at her shoes in shame. But fans excited to see an ""original"" horror film hitting theaters should temper those expectations.",horror history written decade associated trauma metaphor way slasher movie although come cusp new decade new paramount wide release horror movie smile fit right ptsd induced kin difference monster barely metaphor demon evil spirit whatever movie vague point literally feed spread trauma smile like taste people witnessed someone else dying suicide gruesome painful bloody suicide garden shear oncoming train shattered fragment ceramic vase hospital intake room rose briefly meet laura caitlin stasey phd student brought psychiatric emergency ward rose work shaking terrified something get look like people person laura explains saying thing following ever since witnessed one professor bludgeoning death hammer four day earlier end extended dialogue scene open film laura turn rose psychotic grin face proceeds slit throat smile greatest asset relentless oppressive grimness film child pet vulnerable adult horror element bloody disturbing match dark theme unsparing sensibility enhanced bacon shaky vulnerable performance rose one point scream trevor crazy mumble apology look shoe shame fan excited see original horror film hitting theater temper expectation

Firstly, I am shocked at how this is only rated a 7 when I think it's margins above most of the horror films that have been released in recent years.

"So I thought this was going to be a typical, paint by numbers, cheesy horror movie. It's actually enjoyable. From the trailer, it looked like a movie that relied on jump scares only. However, it was unsettling, and well acted. Not a masterpiece, but definitely better than I thought it was going to be. The main character's turn from a logical doctor, to a person who she herself would have written off as someone just suffering from mental health issues was portrayed well. If you like movies like this, you'll be surprised that it's a step above other movies in the same category of horror.

Sosie bacon mesmerized with her acting skills, and she killed it. There were some satirical and funny moments mixed with horror (a very smart mixture). Direction was great but could have focused more on editing, a little weak at the editing part. Started little slower but the story slowly keeps getting interesting.

The part I'm referencing was when the entity showed her sister head hanging. This would have been a good scare. Other than there was no jump scare. The movie was predictable in some parts especially when it comes to the entity passing down to Joel. When he saw her about to light herself on fire all I can think of was run or cover your eyes. However I know witnessing something like that you're hold body might freeze up. Trevor also was a bad fiancé he did not show any understanding but was quick to basically call her crazy.

"There's much to admire here. Excellent camera work evokes horror films of the 70s, the lead actress delivers a strong performance, color grading is good, and the core concept is brilliant. Smiles are creepy, and they're the cheapest possible special effect.Unfortunately and almost inevitably, the initially intriguing concept loses itself towards the end with a predictably banal resolution and open ending you've seen a million times before.Much of the film reminded me of ""it follows"". High concept horror that starts strong, then loses its steam along the way. Smile doesn't have a great score though, and feels somewhat pedestrian with its loud noise jumpscares and a screamy finale you've seen hundred times before.Yes, I get that the smile is an allegory for trauma being passed on, but trauma really doesn't work that way. Still, the film is well made and reasonably entertaining if you turn your brain off and like jump scares.And it's certain to be a lot better than Halloween 27 or whatever cheapo horror Netflix belches out every week.",much admire excellent camera work evokes horror film lead actress delivers strong performance color grading good core concept brilliant smile creepy cheapest possible special effect unfortunately almost inevitably initially intriguing concept loses towards end predictably banal resolution open ending seen million time much film reminded follows high concept horror start strong loses steam along way smile great score though feel somewhat pedestrian loud noise jumpscares screamy finale seen hundred time yes get smile allegory trauma passed trauma really work way still film well made reasonably entertaining turn brain like jump scare certain lot better halloween whatever cheapo horror netflix belch every week

"Scary visuals, kinda predictable. But I always love seeing Kyle Gallner in a horror movie. My main problem is that I came to the conclusion way before the protagonist did.Other than murder, the obvious way to stop the spread is to intentionally kill yourself with no witnesses before the demon gets a chance. Will the demon try to stop your plan to get its way? Sure. But up until the moment it wins, you can just keep trying! And then Kyle Gallner's character, completely aware of the consequences, just stands and watches his fate begin. The second he saw her smiling he shoulda shut his eyes and sprinted away.

"Nothing really unique or original to see here. It's pretty much ""It Follows"" with a fresh coat of paint.90% of the movie relies on generic and lazy jumpscares which don't work on horror veterans for more than a decade at this point.The protagonist of the movie is a prime example of a character who uses critical thinking and should behave and act accordingly during the movie. But the movie needs to happen so she makes all the worst possible decisions and behavior tropes throughout the movie like a generic horror movie side character who dies in the intro.That's the most frustrating thing about this movie, when alone she handles the situation logically. But when surrounded by others where she has a chance to prove her case, she goes full on insane mode for no reason other than it must happen. A complete disconnect.Maybe if the movie was 30 minutes shorter I would have enjoyed it slightly more. As it stands, this is a creepypasta/short story idea bloated to reach that 2 hour mark that most movies suffer from nowadays cause it's the new ""norm"" for movie length.",nothing really unique original see pretty much follows fresh coat paint movie relies generic lazy jumpscares work horror veteran decade point protagonist movie prime example character us critical thinking behave act accordingly movie movie need happen make worst possible decision behavior trope throughout movie like generic horror movie side character dy intro frustrating thing movie alone handle situation logically surrounded others chance prove case go full insane mode reason must happen complete disconnect maybe movie minute shorter would enjoyed slightly stand creepypasta short story idea bloated reach hour mark movie suffer nowadays cause new norm movie length
"The start of the movie is quite interesting. It seemed like a spiritual successor to IT follows: There is a curse that people get and then get tagetted by a monster. However, unlike 'it follows', the rules are never quite clearly spelled out. At some point we are told that murdering another person gets you out of the loop but this is actually never followed up on.In probably the most memorable scene in the movie, the protagonist is talking to her psychologist, when she suddenly calls her, at which point you are supposed to realize that she is actually talking to the monster and she begins to run away. Amazingly though... she begins to run away down the stairs(into the house), and then... the movie cuts... like that scene never occured!Perhaps most importantly, the writers of this movie seem unable to make a choice on where to take the movie and so play out both the scene where the monster is beaten AND the scene where the monster wins in the end. Ultimately, it just feels like they waste a good 20minutes of your time on a completely pointless scene that has no impact. Overall, the film is quite mediocre.",start movie quite interesting seemed like spiritual successor follows curse people get get tagetted monster however unlike follows rule never quite clearly spelled point told murdering another person get loop actually never followed probably memorable scene movie protagonist talking psychologist suddenly call point supposed realize actually talking monster begin run away amazingly though begin run away stair house movie cut like scene never occured perhaps importantly writer movie seem unable make choice take movie play scene monster beaten scene monster win end ultimately feel like waste good minute time completely pointless scene impact overall film quite mediocre
"I was very skeptical that Smile would be any good and after having just finished it I can honestly say that I was Impressed. Hints of It Follows and Malignant, but with a fresh take on it. It was nice to see the story take place in NJ which is where I'm from, so that nostalgic feeling was cool. Quite the scares and usually that stuff doesn't phase me, but it was implemented superbly. The cast did a great job for sure. The story was cool and I loved the ending. No spoilers! I feel that it's this generation's Sinister.

"Such promise. It feels as though modern horror lacks the ability to close the deal. A fantastic creepy world is constructed. Eerie characters are introduced with varying motivations, that keep the viewers on edge. Yet, so many times, the pay off is lackluster. The antagonist is not as frightening as can be. That is where Barbarian suffers. Georgina Campbell, Bill Skarsgard, and Justin Long are excellent. They sell fear with the best I have seen. I was truly on the ride of fear with them. They are disoriented in the middle of now where. I even appreciate the subtle nod toward the effects of gentrification. This movie, has some great bones but loses me in the 4th act.

"""Smile"" wore out its welcome pretty fast. In fact, it took only eight minutes before it landed in ""I don't care"" territory. (I checked the clock.) There are some creepy moments but I never cared about what was going on. That's the kiss of death for any movie. The cast is fine, I guess. The ""check every box"" casting is well intentioned but ends up being obvious and kind of distracting. ""Smile"" is also way too long a movie. Horror movies like this can be fun but pushing it to nearly two hours is a bit much. The last half hour is just one ridiculous development after another. ""Enough already"" came into my head more than once.",smile wore welcome pretty fast fact took eight minute landed care territory checked clock creepy moment never cared going kiss death movie cast fine guess check every box casting well intentioned end obvious kind distracting smile also way long movie horror movie like fun pushing nearly two hour bit much last half hour one ridiculous development another enough already came head
"From the eerie soundtrack and haunting sound design to the unnervingly wide camera shots forcing your eyes to wonder the screen in fear of something lurking ..my goodness,the first 35 mins of this film set itself up to be a modern horror classic or at least a masterclass in good tension building...those sentiments slowly dissipate though as the film continues and you realize that the potentially stylish cinematic horror gem regresses into the spooky jump-scare fall blockbuster it was always meant to be. And to be fair,it's not a terrible one but one still riddled with moot plot points,somewhat cringe performances(such as the homicidal prisoner and the creepy therapist) and unintentionally unlikeable characters.tbh most of the supporting cast was so annoying I figured they were all just going to die...Much to my chagrin,the only person who we're supposed to be rooting for is the only one who actually dies,the protagonist..Now i wont say I was 100 % disappointed,the jump scares-as predictable as they were-were actually pretty clever at times,humorous even. However I'm not entirely sure that was intentional. But those dream sequences did get me every-single-time as well as those those kitchen scenes in the beginning!..We've seen the ""7-days to live"" flicks before like The Ring or even It Follows, and SMILE seeks add itself to that list of horror films. And while entertaining,It didn't bring anything new or groundbreaking to the sub genre and would most likely rank low on that list. Overall SMILE is still a decent horror thriller, and should be a good time with a group of friends but you'll prob all forget about it in

"I wasn't expecting anything, but I ended up liking it quite a bit. So I understand the divided reviews that exist about the film, so I recommend watching it without expectations.Horror movies are in decline, very few are saved, and I think this film is one of the few that try to save the horror genre. An original and innovative plot to a certain extent, is what I liked the most.The direction seemed to me too good, there were moments where I didn't know if it was all real or a dream, it was what I loved the most. It has jumpscare, quite a few, personally they did scare me but it is a very typical resource to give a scare. It also has scenes that disturbed me too much, and above all some very unexpected ones and the ending, personally I didn't expect it.I thought it was going to end very badly, but that psychological touch makes it cooler, the soundtrack has been too strong to cause fear, and a detail that I liked a lot was that in the credits of the film there were creepy sounds. Don't expect to look for real terror when watching it, but it is entertaining.",expecting anything ended liking quite bit understand divided review exist film recommend watching without expectation horror movie decline saved think film one try save horror genre original innovative plot certain extent liked direction seemed good moment know real dream loved jumpscare quite personally scare typical resource give scare also scene disturbed much unexpected one ending personally expect thought going end badly psychological touch make cooler soundtrack strong cause fear detail liked lot credit film creepy sound expect look real terror watching entertaining
"First off, I think the toothy grin stuff is a little corny and seems like it's pulled from a Creepypasta. No hate on Creepypastas or anything, it just seemed goofy for a whole feature.However, the visuals are great! The gore looks good, the edits are clever, the shots are anxiety inducing, etc.But for me this really shines in the sound department; the OST is immaculate. I haven't felt that uncomfortable because of the sound of a film in a long time, and I mean that in the highest form of flattery. It demands attention and then plays with your head. It was very experimental in some ways, and traditional in others.",first think toothy grin stuff little corny seems like pulled creepypasta hate creepypastas anything seemed goofy whole feature however visuals great gore look good edits clever shot anxiety inducing etc really shine sound department ost immaculate felt uncomfortable sound film long time mean highest form flattery demand attention play head experimental way traditional others
Seems nothing is original any more. We've seen this plot of passing evil in a chain way too often with evil always winning. The only way to stop the evil is to commit evil. Tedious and predictable. There is never any explanation of the origin of this evil or a way to defeat it with faith or even self sacrifice to save the ones after you. This movie was particularly off putting with the way it ended. I don't understand the great reviews. Movies used to be far more original and entertaining. The way everyone reacted in this movie was hard to believe too - the characters were all off putting and their decisions and actions didn't feel plausible.,seems nothing original seen plot passing evil chain way often evil always winning way stop evil commit evil tedious predictable never explanation origin evil way defeat faith even self sacrifice save one movie particularly putting way ended understand great review movie used far original entertaining way everyone reacted movie hard believe character putting decision action feel plausible

Yeah, it made me jump and squirm too. I can't say that the story was out of this world original, it had the typical progression of any horror film but it was enough to keep me interested.

"The movie was plain and simply put okay. Not a bad or great horror movie. I found the movie to be pretty generic, and it's not really a new «style» of a horror movie. The characters were typical characters you'd see in this kind of movie, nothing we haven't seen before. I also felt it was kind of dragged out. 2 hours was a stretch in my opinion, and by 1.5h in, i was waiting for it to just end.

If you have never seen a movie or a video in your entire life before you might enjoy it.If you enjoy white women screaming their lungs out for two hours, I would recommend any season of American Horror story with Sarah Paulson on the cast, instead of this movie.Awful just don't give your time to this and don't watch it's inevitable sequel because it probably made some money.",movie could email either fake ending could ending would much better le waste lifetime creature design right end sucked goofiest unintentionally hilarious thing ever seen people audience literally laughing whenever screen never seen movie video entire life might enjoy enjoy white woman screaming lung two hour would recommend season american horror story sarah paulson cast instead movie awful give time watch inevitable sequel probably made money
"Okay, let me just start by saying that horror/ suspense/ thriller/ whateveryoucallit is not really my bag. Fake blood doesn't scare me. Jump scares startle me, but piss me off. And I hate most horror tropes.But there are occasionally the rare movies in this genre that while I don't LIKE them, I appreciate them for sort of breaking the mold or being better done than most. Smile is that. I appreciate it, but I don't necessarily LIKE it, and I think it's sub-7 rating on IMDB is a travesty. I'm tempted to give it an 8 just because of it being underrated, but again - I don't really like it, so can I give a movie I don't like better than a 7?Let's start with that I like. I LOVE the ending. I don't want to spoil it, but I really like it when movies give me an unconventional ending. I also like that for about half the movie, we're not really sure if a supernatural thing is REALLY happening, or if it's just insanity. I feel like the movie would have benefitted from keeping that ambiguous.The lead actress is amazing. Everyone around her ... is not. I mean, she really sells everything she needs to sell, I feel. Everyone else just sort of feels like scenery. Maybe the exception is the sister, but even she kind of left me underwhelmed.I like attaching the horror to the idea of a creepy smile. It's part of why clowns are creepy or CG that is in the Uncanny Valley. If anything, I'm annoyed that the movie didn't make MORE of this plot point. It felt like a Chekov's Gun, like it should have been more important than it was.Let's talk problems. The characters around Rose largely do way too little to help her. Even Joel, who is the only one who seems to genuinely give a damn kind of underwhelms. He's just the plot device that lets her visit an inmate or research the pattern. In the end, he does very little.The setup definitely seems to have unexplored threads. They reference a chain in Brazil...but then Rose never expresses interest in how it ended. Murder can make it skip a person, but how did it end...or didn't it? If no one lasts a week...why not commit one's self and be restrained until that passes? Maybe the entity fades if not satisfied.There are too many standard horror tropes. While I wouldn't say this movie RELIES on jump-scares and gross-out fake blood...there are moments when it indulges these things and they add very little to the movie, and irritate a non-horror person like myself.Ultimately, I think there was more good than bad, and it's better than most horror flicks.",okay let start saying horror suspense thriller whateveryoucallit really bag fake blood scare jump scare startle piss hate horror trope occasionally rare movie genre like appreciate sort breaking mold better done smile appreciate necessarily like think sub rating imdb travesty tempted give underrated really like give movie like better let start like love ending want spoil really like movie give unconventional ending also like half movie really sure supernatural thing really happening insanity feel like movie would benefitted keeping ambiguous lead actress amazing everyone around mean really sell everything need sell feel everyone else sort feel like scenery maybe exception sister even kind left underwhelmed like attaching horror idea creepy smile part clown creepy cg uncanny valley anything annoyed movie make plot point felt like chekov gun like important let talk problem character around rose largely way little help even joel one seems genuinely give damn kind underwhelms plot device let visit inmate research pattern end little setup definitely seems unexplored thread reference chain brazil rose never express interest ended murder make skip person end one last week commit one self restrained pass maybe entity fade satisfied many standard horror trope say movie relies jump scare gross fake blood moment indulges thing add little movie irritate non horror person like ultimately think good bad better horror flick
"I have not heard of all that ""hype"" about ""Smile"" that some people claim, a friend of mine asked me to go check it out because he's seen trailer for ""Smile"" during one of his theater previews and the thought it might be good. So we checked it out.Plot isn't really that original or great, it has very similar plot to ""It Follows"" where main character gets talked by unseen entity that plagues her everyday life, all up to somewhat unsatisfying and somewhat generic ending.However, what ""Smile"" does have is some nice direction and good production, goes for unsettling atmosphere and mood much like ""It Follow"" however it wants to be more gritty then experimental dream like ""It Follows"". It starts out good and strong but somewhat drags in the middle because of repetition of it's set-pieces, and it has somewhat generic and unsatisfying ending, however I am willing to give it a pass because ending to plot like this can really be tough to pull off right even for some horror veterans (most notably for example Stephen King, who is known to have hit or miss endings to his novels)I give it ""6"" mostly for it's production and solid direction and surprisingly good acting for this type of movie, despite not-so-original plot. ""Smile"" does hit all of the notes for horror movie, however it doesn't really push any new ground or at least tries to be experimental like it's ""It follows"" counterpart, so it's solid production values are kinda wasted on generic Blumhouse-type horror movie.",heard hype smile people claim friend mine asked go check seen trailer smile one theater preview thought might good checked plot really original great similar plot follows main character get talked unseen entity plague everyday life somewhat unsatisfying somewhat generic ending however smile nice direction good production go unsettling atmosphere mood much like follow however want gritty experimental dream like follows start good strong somewhat drag middle repetition set piece somewhat generic unsatisfying ending however willing give pas ending plot like really tough pull right even horror veteran notably example stephen king known hit miss ending novel give mostly production solid direction surprisingly good acting type movie despite original plot smile hit note horror movie however really push new ground least try experimental like follows counterpart solid production value kinda wasted generic blumhouse type horror movie

She starts having similar visions herself and mentally deteriorates.This is one creepy horror. The concept is simple and interesting.

"A clear and obvious rip-off of the movie Fallen. The protagonist, whose performance was so poor that I won't even attempt to look up her name even though I am on IMDB, witnesses an event. From that point the story collapses into a series of events which the character either lacks the vocabulary to properly explain to others or, at other times, refuses to reveal to those who she should logically trust.I actually wanted to like this movie. The character of Holly is too 'over the top'.

"From the first frame to the last - I was onboard. This film is unique, very well written and the acting was superb. Not just for a horror movie either.Sosie Bacon is the highlight. Keep your eyes on hers and you'll see what I mean. It isn't trope-ridden, nor does it rely on jump-scares for thrills. The premise isn't new, far from it, but as I said - it's unique.The gore is minimal and those scenes aren't overly explicit. Just enough to make you wince and mutter ""WTF"" into your clutched pillow. The visuals are reminiscent of ""The Ring"", a few quick blasts of extremely disturbing still images.It's also well shot. The movement is smooth and slow throughout, almost Krubrekian I'd say. Tension is ratcheted up at the right pace.12,000 people added this to their Watchlist.

"This movie was a tense and unnerving ride from start to finish, which I think is perfect for a horror film. The camera work was always presented in a way that would make you think something awful is about to happen to constantly make you tense in the more calm points, and still scare the crap out of you when it finally does. The pacing was perfect with characters you could easily latch onto or understand pretty well. Even the ending was terrifically horrifying that you have to see it to believe it. I would say to avoid as much of the trailers as possible since it kind of ruins some of the bigger scares when watching, but that's a marketing issue and does not put a damper on the film. Watch this at your peril knowing it's gonna be one of the most terrifying experiences you've had in a while.

"Creepy but not enough! The movie follows a typical horror movie motif; despite the addition of specifics, some details are still rather predictable. There were some scenes that reminded me of It Follows. The horror component was subtly handled though some of the jump scare scenes were a bit redundant. The character were built quite well, they all had their personal marks but at the same time the film also made a typical mistake of making the supporting characters become overly stupid. The main character's psychological development was well portrayed, giving the audience sympathy.

"I watched Smile back in September 2022 and while I liked it and definitely thought it was better than what I expected, I also felt the film was a bit too similar to Japanese horror remakes (like the Grudge or the Ring) and their American ""curse movie"" derivatives (like Drag Me to Hell and Truth or Dare). Like, you kind of know where this movie is going and what's going to happen, and at the time, having also just seen Barbarian, Smile sort of paled in comparison.Yet, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this movie, and I think I definitely underrated it when I first saw it.This is a brilliant movie. It takes a simple premise, but really, for lack of a better term, ""elevates"" it by using the film's premise as an allegory for mental illness, suicidal contagion, and the societal expectation to just grin and bear it (literally).Sosie Bacon's excellent performance grounds what otherwise might come off as a silly movie. She brings real pathos and humanity to the performance, and it's hard not to empathize with her. But it's also easy to see why people around her - her sister, her boyfriend, her therapist - find it difficult to connect with her as well. As a therapist herself, Bacon's character tries to intellectualize and problem solve what is clearly out of her control, and her descent into madness is played so well, it's reasonable that people would assume she was just going crazy.But what I like the most about this movie (aside from its utterly TERRIFYING last 10 minutes), is that is poses a very provocative question. What if we can't really ""get over"" our trauma? What if we are doomed to suffer from it and it can strike back at us at a moment's notice? What if the human mind and soul cannot be healed? Realistically, we know this to be true, but to see it so vividly in front of us is rare and only really possible in horror.Smile takes a premise you'd expect to be gimmicky and does something really thoughtful and interesting with it. The smile isn't there because it's a creepy image. It's there because we all hides behind smiles. All the time. Especially when things are difficult, yet we don't want to reveal that to a world that doesn't care.That's the scariest thing about Smile.",watched smile back september liked definitely thought better expected also felt film bit similar japanese horror remake like grudge ring american curse movie derivative like drag hell truth dare like kind know movie going going happen time also seen barbarian smile sort paled comparison yet able stop thinking movie think definitely underrated first saw brilliant movie take simple premise really lack better term elevates using film premise allegory mental illness suicidal contagion societal expectation grin bear literally sosie bacon excellent performance ground otherwise might come silly movie brings real pathos humanity performance hard empathize also easy see people around sister boyfriend therapist find difficult connect well therapist bacon character try intellectualize problem solve clearly control descent madness played well reasonable people would assume going crazy like movie aside utterly terrifying last minute pose provocative question really get trauma doomed suffer strike back u moment notice human mind soul cannot healed realistically know true see vividly front u rare really possible horror smile take premise expect gimmicky something really thoughtful interesting smile creepy image hide behind smile time especially thing difficult yet want reveal world care scariest thing smile

"I wasn't excited when I saw the trailer, which felt overly campy and too cheesy to deliver much terror, but I'm a devoted scary movie fan and knew I'd see it anyway.And it was worth it.A mark of good horror, I think, is not that it surprises you (a la jumpscares) but that it disturbs you in some primal way, so that even when you know what's coming, you still aren't prepared for how frightening or unsettling it will be. I felt like Smile showed too many cards in the trailers, but even though I had some expectations going in, I felt like the frights landed suitably hard, even when you expected them, and kept you feeling unnerved on several levels.In the most basic sense, it could be a narrative on surviving trauma (which is common in horror), but more than that, it was an effective character transformation which Caitlin Stasey embraces and excels at. Her acting shines, which is vital as everything in this movie hinges on the believability of her depiction of Laura Weaver, a haunted, overworked therapist struggling with her personal life.Smile makes you feel many things. It isn't always breaking new ground with the material, but it knows how to handle the material confidently, and does justice to the genre with a very watchable and thrilling journey through the human mind.Yes, it's psychological (the main character is a shrink after all) so yes it has some commentary on mental health issues, but it plays out in a relatable way that creates empathy between the viewer and the character in a way many horror movies do not.Worth the watch, but it won't make you Smile.",excited saw trailer felt overly campy cheesy deliver much terror devoted scary movie fan knew see anyway worth mark good horror think surprise la jumpscares disturbs primal way even know coming still prepared frightening unsettling felt like smile showed many card trailer even though expectation going felt like fright landed suitably hard even expected kept feeling unnerved several level basic sense could narrative surviving trauma common horror effective character transformation caitlin stasey embrace excels acting shine vital everything movie hinge believability depiction laura weaver haunted overworked therapist struggling personal life smile make feel many thing always breaking new ground material know handle material confidently justice genre watchable thrilling journey human mind yes psychological main character shrink yes commentary mental health issue play relatable way creates empathy viewer character way many horror movie worth watch make smile
"Perhaps the writers thought having a more artistic edge to its cinematography (ie keep flipping the camera upside down for landscape shots) added a more darker, surreal tone to be taken more seriously; Perhaps they also thought no one over 8 who watches horror movies would see this. This is a mass up, a decent one at least, of three superior movies - It Follows (unseen demon except for the victim that hunts its victim slowly after being passed on), The Ring (the ticking clock timetable till its gets you) and Fallen, the Denzel Washington film from the 90s where the ending was straight up ripped off from.

"THIS is the creepiest horror title of the year. Post viewing this, it is almost sacrilegious to think that it could NOT have premiered on the big screen.It is super creepy, with jump scares that would live up to their name and make you jump, while making your hackles stand up.It is supremely well acted. It is derivative of few supernatural movies of yore, such as The Ring and It Follows, but it puts such a unique spin, that it makes for truly enjoyable and nasty viewing.Unlike the other horror titles of the year, it keeps the scares at frequent intervals from start to the end and makes it a point of ending on a high.I really loved it. One of the more engaging spooky films of recent times.

"Here's a movie I was thinking was going to be a great horror movie. Not only is not great, it's boring for a Horror movie. It's a complete ripoff of ""It Follows"". It's very slow with only a few action scenes. The atmosphere was excellent. Shame, even with great atmosphere, they couldn't make the film work. I kinda wish I had my 2 hours back. It's about a doctor who, after watching a patient kill herself, begins seeing strange things. These strange images and people are what haunts her throughout the film. She begins losing her mind, and towards the end of the film we have no closure at all. Which to be sounds like a excuse for a sequel. Let's hope not.",movie thinking going great horror movie great boring horror movie complete ripoff follows slow action scene atmosphere excellent shame even great atmosphere make film work kinda wish hour back doctor watching patient kill begin seeing strange thing strange image people haunt throughout film begin losing mind towards end film closure sound like excuse sequel let hope
"For me at its core smile is about how people smile and say ""they're fine"" to issues that over time can build up and have an effect on someone. Traumatic events included. The deeper message being getting therapy or speaking with those close to you being the way to get over such issues and be healed. If not healed this trauma can effect an individual that their resultant behaviour can affect others thus creating a cycle where trauma is passed on from person to person.The main characters mother dies as a result of a presumed overdose and her not calling for an ambulance to save her, the guilt eats away at her until she cracks years later. It is hinted at several times that speaking to someone would help, including a part where a magazine saying ""last chance"" could be seen shortly before the main character receives a phone call from her therapist which she declines, sealing her fate.The first half of this movie is great, there is an air of mystic and some of the jump scares are unique and quite good. The concept of an unsettling smile being the focal point of a horror is also quite good.However around halfway into the film I'd say the movie becomes somewhat predictable and becomes a bit stale. They don't do as many jump scares and until 10mins before the end don't really delve deeper into the core message of the film.Overall a good concept movie with some good scares and starts great, doesn't quite stick the landing and latter half of the movie is flat with a lack of both scares and depth. Because of the promising start the second half feels that all the more disappointing.6/10.",core smile people smile say fine issue time build effect someone traumatic event included deeper message getting therapy speaking close way get issue healed healed trauma effect individual resultant behaviour affect others thus creating cycle trauma passed person person main character mother dy result presumed overdose calling ambulance save guilt eats away crack year later hinted several time speaking someone would help including part magazine saying last chance could seen shortly main character receives phone call therapist decline sealing fate first half movie great air mystic jump scare unique quite good concept unsettling smile focal point horror also quite good however around halfway film say movie becomes somewhat predictable becomes bit stale many jump scare min end really delve deeper core message film overall good concept movie good scare start great quite stick landing latter half movie flat lack scare depth promising start second half feel disappointing
"Smile addresses the impact of mental health on society. It unpacks how many of us never deal with our inner traumas. There is this universal fear of being lonely in the world, and isolation impacts the people in our social networks. Smiles can oftentimes be a mask, and neglect is not a silent killer. The supporting cast was remarkable. Many of these actors get to explore their range. It's disturbing, bazaar ,and there parts that will probably make you shizz your pants. I will never sleep at night again. Sosie Bacon took this role and ran with it, her performance was certainly a surprise.

"I was SO excited for this film, truly. The concept was simple but interesting. The creatures design and final reveal was PHENOMENAL. A good creature design is something that haunts you just by appearance alone, and it did for me. The whole reason why I watched the film was to see that thing in the end. But, my god, I actually despise this film.My disappointment is immeasurable. Things were good in the beginning, and what happened at the birthday party was insane, but for a movie that follows a finicky concept such as ""creepy smiling,"" you have to be careful with how you use it. The scares were not good. The bodymorphing of the creature, was not scary, and my god, the ending was horrendous. Also, the scene with the therapist? The effect they put over her voice was NOT scary nor good whatsoever. It really took me out of the moment, and reminded me that I was watching a horror film, except now I realized just how cliche it all was.The reason I despise this film is because it looked so promising to me, and yet it felt like the film spat right in my face when I finally sat down to watch it.",excited film truly concept simple interesting creature design final reveal phenomenal good creature design something haunt appearance alone whole reason watched film see thing end god actually despise film disappointment immeasurable thing good beginning happened birthday party insane movie follows finicky concept creepy smiling careful use scare good bodymorphing creature scary god ending horrendous also scene therapist effect put voice scary good whatsoever really took moment reminded watching horror film except realized cliche reason despise film looked promising yet felt like film spat right face finally sat watch

I was hooked from the beginning. It had a great start. That encounter with that patient was absolutely terrifying. Her smile is easily nightmare fuel. But... Then ?? Rose was one of those characters you get attached and want no harm to happen. She was so precious. She and the detective are the only interesting characters. The rest have literally NO depth. Her bf is literally pointless and her sister gives a headache. Her boyfriend character was one you can easily forget. At some points I had forgotten he even existed in the film. Her sister was probably meant to be annoying. So many jump scares that were totally not necessary. Its like they have built a great foundation and completely destroyed it later. DISAPPOINTED. LETS not even talk how they kill off both of the best characters with some kind of a smile curse.

"Smile is an unnerving story that touches on mental illness and a detachment from reality. Or IS it?.....Ok, let's get the cons and cliches out of the way. Yes, I recognize that the whole ""creepy smile and cocking of the head at an angle while executing said unnerving smile"" acting method is overplayed, and even a bit hack. But this film pulls it off pretty well. Unless it's an absolute pet peeve of yours when watching horror movies, it should be a pretty entertaining flick.Some parts will catch you off guard, some parts will be confusing, but all in all, it's an intense, well made movie that I heavily recommend.You may never look at a birthday present the same again.",smile unnerving story touch mental illness detachment reality ok let get con cliche way yes recognize whole creepy smile cocking head angle executing said unnerving smile acting method overplayed even bit hack film pull pretty well unless absolute pet peeve watching horror movie pretty entertaining flick part catch guard part confusing intense well made movie heavily recommend may never look birthday present

"First of all it's important to say that Smile borrows a lot from The Invisible Man movie. You have the identical slow descent of a woman into paranoia and madness while everybody close to her starts to turn on her. You similarly have many men doing a lot of mansplaining while she sees things no one else can. They even copied that exact same scene where she will face complete disbelief and rejection from her sister at her door step. No coincidence here.The paranormal aspect is basically that classic ""let's cheat death"" trope seen before in The Final Destination or It Follows. It's just a bit more confusing and vague save for the smile gimmick and a lot - and I mean a lot- of jump scares.But as soon as our traumatized lead gets completely isolated and randomly goes back to her ex, the movie loses steam and turns into a detective mystery that doesn't make much sense. The movie redeems itself in the last act with some fun CGI and claustrophobic visuals that will make you forgive the lack of logic or even a resolution.Ultimately Smile is another one of those recent horror movies that has very clever marketing and gotcha moments but not much in terms of plot. What Smile does have though is a fantastic and very unnerving soundtrack from the White Lotus composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer.Absolutely loved the music particularly in the last scene!",first important say smile borrows lot invisible man movie identical slow descent woman paranoia madness everybody close start turn similarly many men lot mansplaining see thing one else even copied exact scene face complete disbelief rejection sister door step coincidence paranormal aspect basically classic let cheat death trope seen final destination follows bit confusing vague save smile gimmick lot mean lot jump scare soon traumatized lead get completely isolated randomly go back ex movie loses steam turn detective mystery make much sense movie redeems last act fun cgi claustrophobic visuals make forgive lack logic even resolution ultimately smile another one recent horror movie clever marketing gotcha moment much term plot smile though fantastic unnerving soundtrack white lotus composer cristobal tapia de veer absolutely loved music particularly last scene
"Reminds me of Drag Me To Hell, and The Ring (both great horror movies).Yes, the jump-scares are used very frequently and you just learn to expect them. However, they are very well done jumpscares that I personally did not expect. One of the scares got me REALLY good, I totally did not see it coming! It was when Rose's sister came up to the car and suddenly her head flipped upside down. It was amazingly done because it was broad daylight and she was wearing a pink sweater, and the last thing you expect is a jump scare in that scene. You expect jump scares when they close a fridge door, or there's a dark doorway, or the character is slowly walking through their home at night. You just don't expect a jump scare in that daylight, pink sweater, seemingly innocent scene. I thought that was very well done.The story is interesting and I like the descent into madness, but also I like the mystery of it and Rose's attempt to solve the mystery.The flaw of the movie is that the mystery is not actually that deep because there is no explanation of why and what the hell the ""demon"" thing is. All we find out is how it works, but we don't ever learn what it is, where it's from, where is started, etc.Additionally, I predicted the ending almost perfectly which is a bit disappointing. I knew that when she set the house and demon on fire, and seemingly won, that it was not over. I nailed that her cop ex-boyfriend (Carl?) was going to suddenly smile and let us know it's not over. And that's exactly what happened.The ending also was not satisfying. I wanted to see the story concluded, but the demon was passed onto Carl which means it didn't end and plus, we expected this to happen.",reminds drag hell ring great horror movie yes jump scare used frequently learn expect however well done jumpscares personally expect one scare got really good totally see coming rose sister came car suddenly head flipped upside amazingly done broad daylight wearing pink sweater last thing expect jump scare scene expect jump scare close fridge door dark doorway character slowly walking home night expect jump scare daylight pink sweater seemingly innocent scene thought well done story interesting like descent madness also like mystery rose attempt solve mystery flaw movie mystery actually deep explanation hell demon thing find work ever learn started etc additionally predicted ending almost perfectly bit disappointing knew set house demon fire seemingly nailed cop ex boyfriend carl going suddenly smile let u know exactly happened ending also satisfying wanted see story concluded demon passed onto carl mean end plus expected happen
"I remember when I first saw the trailer for 'Smile' a friend turned to me and asked if I thought it would be any good. I said something to the effect of ""no chance"". Horror films with a gimmick like this over the past decade have almost never turned out to be good. So I was pretty shocked when the film was released to some pretty glowing feedback.It has to be said, when someone smiles at an inappropriate time it is very creepy. The concept is actually a very good one to base a horror movie around. That wasn't going to be enough though, they still had to make the film well, and they did a pretty good job of it.The film is a mix of jump scares (some earned and others not), creepy visuals, mini-twists and a little bit of hard hitting imagery. There are a couple of excellently crafted jump scares. The type that literally make you jump out of your seat. There's a really good mix of all those components throughout the film though, and I think that is why it works so well and is able to justify a longer runtime than most horror movies would dare to go for.The film does lose a little steam for a period through the middle. It also has that annoying thing going on where the audience is frustrated no one will believe the lead character - however in real life, would you believe someone claiming these things? Of course not.When the film is good though, it is really good. I also absolutely loved the ending and the fact that they had the guts to go for it. This was a really good one. 8.5/10.",remember first saw trailer smile friend turned asked thought would good said something effect chance horror film gimmick like past decade almost never turned good pretty shocked film released pretty glowing feedback said someone smile inappropriate time creepy concept actually good one base horror movie around going enough though still make film well pretty good job film mix jump scare earned others creepy visuals mini twist little bit hard hitting imagery couple excellently crafted jump scare type literally make jump seat really good mix component throughout film though think work well able justify longer runtime horror movie would dare go film lose little steam period middle also annoying thing going audience frustrated one believe lead character however real life would believe someone claiming thing course film good though really good also absolutely loved ending fact gut go really good one
"This movie is a horror worth watching. It is entertaining and fun to watch. It is not very original, I agree with other posts about it being very similar to The Ring and It Follows, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. If Hollywood is out of fresh ideas and wants to keep making the same type of thing, that's fine with me as long as they keep it entertaining like this movie was.I think the characters actions were not completely out of the realm of what someone might do. Although, I do feel Rose should have gone into the woods (in a place where her body could not be found and ""traumatize"" anyone) and kill herself. I think this would have ended the line. I wish we could have had this ending, I'm tired of the mysterious/ominous entity/curse/etc anyways winning. I think that ending would have been a draw. Also it would have been something a little different and less expected. I am hoping if they do a sequel with the cop boyfriend then this is how they end that one.Also, I like that there are no political messages distracting us from the plot!",movie horror worth watching entertaining fun watch original agree post similar ring follows stop enjoying hollywood fresh idea want keep making type thing fine long keep entertaining like movie think character action completely realm someone might although feel rose gone wood place body could found traumatize anyone kill think would ended line wish could ending tired mysterious ominous entity curse etc anyways winning think ending would draw also would something little different le expected hoping sequel cop boyfriend end one also like political message distracting u plot
"First things first: if you won't watch a movie because a pet of one of the main characters dies, steer clear. There's a pet cat, and it dies.Now: the marketing for Smile was incredible. The trailer, stupendous. The actual movie? Forgettable. Terrible. Regrettable casting choices. Horrid CGI. Way too many jumpscares, and not enough actual horror.The basic premise is that Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a therapist who watched her mother commit suicide when she was 10 years old, and has bore the burden of guilt through her life and let it define her.Then, while in a session with a new patient, the patient also kills herself, but not before describing an entity/presence which has attached itself to her, something that looks like a person but isn't, something that's always smiling. Rose is traumatised, but continues to attempt to see patients.She, too, then begins to see people smiling.Her ex-husband is a cop who helps find out about a string of suicides caused by seeing someone else commit suicide. She's the latest victim in a long line of suicides. Most people who see a suicide won't last a week before doing the same to themselves. So she has to not only survive, but figure out a way to get rid of it.Do we care if she does or not?No.She's an incompetent therapist. She's a terrible sibling (although her sister and brother-in-law are also terrible). She kills her cat (but apparently not on purpose).The point is: at no point did I care whether she survived or not. Even finding out that she let her mother die from her overdose rather than call an ambulance didn't make me feel anything.I felt sorry for her fiancé. And her ex-husband. And her boss.But at no point did I care about the main character.This type of movie has been done before, though, where an entity is passed on and you either survive it, pass it on, or die. ""It Follows"" was incredible, and this movie feels like the writer/director/producer watched it and asked, ""what if I do that, but with suicide?!""There are way too many jumpscares, but none of them are actually scary, just loud. At no point was I scared. Angry about the cat, yes. Wondering how long the movie had left, yes. Scared? Never. It was gross at points, but also fell victim to the curse of bad CGI where a knife plunged into a victim's chest and moved like it was made of jelly.And don't get me started on the reveal of the entity at the end.There's a feeling that permeates the entire movie, and it's not fear: it's boredom. Do yourself a favour and watch somethinge else.",first thing first watch movie pet one main character dy steer clear pet cat dy marketing smile incredible trailer stupendous actual movie forgettable terrible regrettable casting choice horrid cgi way many jumpscares enough actual horror basic premise rose cotter sosie bacon therapist watched mother commit suicide year old bore burden guilt life let define session new patient patient also kill describing entity presence attached something look like person something always smiling rose traumatised continues attempt see patient begin see people smiling ex husband cop help find string suicide caused seeing someone else commit suicide latest victim long line suicide people see suicide last week survive figure way get rid care incompetent therapist terrible sibling although sister brother law also terrible kill cat apparently purpose point point care whether survived even finding let mother die overdose rather call ambulance make feel anything felt sorry fianc ex husband bos point care main character type movie done though entity passed either survive pas die follows incredible movie feel like writer director producer watched asked suicide way many jumpscares none actually scary loud point scared angry cat yes wondering long movie left yes scared never gross point also fell victim curse bad cgi knife plunged victim chest moved like made jelly get started reveal entity end feeling permeates entire movie fear boredom favour watch somethinge else

"This movie was unfortunately not worth the watch. It succeeds in creepiness with the smiling thing and mood setting. The lead actress is very good while some supporting actors are not. And while the plot is explained, the smiling motif isn't which means it was just a forced device for a creepy effect, which takes away from the plot. I think it could have been better. I was falling asleep by the end.What boggles my mind is how this and a comparative psychological thriller The Babadook have practically the same rating at about 6.7/10.

"Unnerving. The audio production on this film is probably the best experience since Bohemian Rhapsody. The sound effects and score were offensive and disturbing (which added to the terror).The changes in chronology that happen are really cerebral and clever. I read other reviews saying that it's typical Hollywood horror and I really disagree. I felt that this film was unique. However, it does seem to fall flat compared to legendary horror films. The jump scares were also plentiful and when paired with the jarring sound effects, it was a genuine adrenaline rush for everyone in the theater.The monster looks like Marilyn Manson and it absolutely killed the credibility of it. That's why it loses two stars.",unnerving audio production film probably best experience since bohemian rhapsody sound effect score offensive disturbing added terror change chronology happen really cerebral clever read review saying typical hollywood horror really disagree felt film unique however seem fall flat compared legendary horror film jump scare also plentiful paired jarring sound effect genuine adrenaline rush everyone theater monster look like marilyn manson absolutely killed credibility loses two star
"This movie definitely has a lot going for it. It's not the best written and definitely uses tropes/ jump scares to get the horror across. It's just so well done and chilled me to the bones everytime that I didn't mind it. The ending felt to me like an It Follows clone and I was able to guess the ending sequence before it ever happened. These bleak endings in horror films are getting used to death and for me it takes away from the enjoyment so I had to knock it a few points.

"2* out of 10*Not the worst horror of the year (turn towards The Black Phone for that) but close to it. Another sad example of soulless modern day horror. It encapsulates all that is wrong with today's concept of ""viral horror"": Find a paper thin but creepy premise that is merely sufficient for a short film (this one is based on a short) and then stretch it out to 90 minutes (in this case even way longer, god this film tested my patience). This is then only played for creepy images and spooky jump scares which can be shown in a viral trailer to create a hype which tricks people into seeing the film.Certain elements of this were ok, it had mostly competent direction, good camera work and visuals (even though I don't like the Instagram-brown-pastell-color-pallet these films are using). Actress in the first scene was phenomenal! Unfortunately, this can't be said for the main actress (Kevin Bacon's (!) daughter seems to not have inherited her father's incredible talent). The second awesome scene was the birthday gift unwrapping scene. However, two scenes are not enough to salvage this train wreck.What starts out with a truly impressive opening scene (liked that one better than the short) soon turns into the most frustrating jump scare fest serving us every horror cliché out there. By the end I was just rooting for the protagonist to get it over with and botch herself already.I know why our protagonist is working double shifts in a run-down hospital instead of earning loads of money in a private practice: She is THE WORST psychotherapist ever and probably couldn't find a job elsewhere. She does not believe her patients and shows no genuine empathy towards them. She idly watches as her patient goes about slicing herself up with a shard of glass. She notices tons of signs that she herself might not be sane but she ignores all the red flags and lies to her boss (who is also THE WORST). After the curse of The Ring... sorry, I mean It Follows... excuse me, I mean The Smile latches itself onto her, she starts seeing JUMP SCARES, I mean things and visions and slowly loses her sanity. She is a therapist, who has visions, she should know how to handle these things, she knows she is not crazy. So what does she do whenever anything weird happens? She tries to get help (from her boss, boy-friend, sister) by babbling incoherent nonsense that must come off as absolutely insane to anybody and keeps repeating in a hysterical voice: ""I am NOT CRAZY!"" She's a therapist for god's sake! That's exactly the behaviour her patients must be showing all the time. She should know better. This is very bad writing and extremely frustrating for a thinking viewer.Why do protagonists of (cheap) horror movies love to hang around their creepily sterile and severely under-lit homes without ever turning the lights on? You know the answer: jump scares! Lots of them. Accompanied by loud musical cues and bangs (booh!). This is always a sign that the filmmakers don't really have anything to say and are not able to grip their viewers by way of storytelling or psychological horror. This film had SO MANY jump scares.The boyfriend is THE WORST. He shows no empathy or understanding, abandoning his girlfriend basically at the first sign of problems and unease. He barely reacts when he comes home to police sirens. In the last act he literally disappears and does not even try to contact let alone even find Rose after she takes off completely dishevelled.Her sister is THE WORST. After being at least co-responsible for Rose's trauma, leaving her alone with their suicidal and alcoholic mother, does she learn from her mistakes? No. She shows no empathy or understanding, abandoning her sister (again!) basically at the first sign of problems and unease. Completely shuts her out when she needs her the most.The ex-boyfriend cop is THE WORST. Showing Rose confidential evidence abusing his access rights to get information, because he wants to get back in her pants. This would definitely get any cop fired. He is single-handedly responsible for Rose's death. He knows how the curse works. He knows that the entity needs to have the victims kill themselves in front of a witness. Still, he breaks down the door to enter the house and to watch Rose drench herself in gasoline!!!!! He could have just stayed outside the house. This was so mind-numbingly dumb and frustrating.Did I mention the jump scares yet?Ultimately, the film doesn't have anything to say. It stirs up all kinds of themes around guilt, family, generational trauma, mental illness. However, these are just used as an occasion for a scare fest but never brought together in a convincing fashion. There is no resolution to this, no message. Rose doesn't overcome any of her struggles. In the final act we are led to believe she defends her trauma (the ridiculous granny monster). However, this is also just a fake-out as she ultimately does end up killing herself. I am a sucker for bleak endings, if they are done right and either serve a purpose or fit the tone of the movie. In the case of Smile, the ending is just bleak for the sake of being shocking, which is cynical. Well, I guess it kind of fits the tone of the movie after all: They wanted to end it with what they love most, a cheap jump scare.",worst horror year turn towards black phone close another sad example soulless modern day horror encapsulates wrong today concept viral horror find paper thin creepy premise merely sufficient short film one based short stretch minute case even way longer god film tested patience played creepy image spooky jump scare shown viral trailer create hype trick people seeing film certain element ok mostly competent direction good camera work visuals even though like instagram brown pastell color pallet film using actress first scene phenomenal unfortunately said main actress kevin bacon daughter seems inherited father incredible talent second awesome scene birthday gift unwrapping scene however two scene enough salvage train wreck start truly impressive opening scene liked one better short soon turn frustrating jump scare fest serving u every horror clich end rooting protagonist get botch already know protagonist working double shift run hospital instead earning load money private practice worst psychotherapist ever probably find job elsewhere believe patient show genuine empathy towards idly watch patient go slicing shard glass notice ton sign might sane ignores red flag lie bos also worst curse ring sorry mean follows excuse mean smile latch onto start seeing jump scare mean thing vision slowly loses sanity therapist vision know handle thing know crazy whenever anything weird happens try get help bos boy friend sister babbling incoherent nonsense must come absolutely insane anybody keep repeating hysterical voice crazy therapist god sake exactly behaviour patient must showing time know better bad writing extremely frustrating thinking viewer protagonist cheap horror movie love hang around creepily sterile severely lit home without ever turning light know answer jump scare lot accompanied loud musical cue bang booh always sign filmmaker really anything say able grip viewer way storytelling psychological horror film many jump scare boyfriend worst show empathy understanding abandoning girlfriend basically first sign problem unease barely reacts come home police siren last act literally disappears even try contact let alone even find rose take completely dishevelled sister worst least co responsible rose trauma leaving alone suicidal alcoholic mother learn mistake show empathy understanding abandoning sister basically first sign problem unease completely shuts need ex boyfriend cop worst showing rose confidential evidence abusing access right get information want get back pant would definitely get cop fired single handedly responsible rose death know curse work know entity need victim kill front witness still break door enter house watch rose drench gasoline could stayed outside house mind numbingly dumb frustrating mention jump scare yet ultimately film anything say stir kind theme around guilt family generational trauma mental illness however used occasion scare fest never brought together convincing fashion resolution message rose overcome struggle final act led believe defends trauma ridiculous granny monster however also fake ultimately end killing sucker bleak ending done right either serve purpose fit tone movie case smile ending bleak sake shocking cynical well guess kind fit tone movie wanted end love cheap jump scare

"The premise had potential to be a cool original idea, the movie starts off pretty cool and has a nice little mystery, but then starts to a follow a very familiar formula, seems like the writers either have never watched the Ring or just decided to rip it off, the jump scares were there if that's what you're into, not as creepy as the trailers made it out to be sadly. If you've watched, It Follows, The Ring, and Fallen, you've pretty much watched this one. Even though the movie is not as fresh as I had hoped, it is still enjoyable, people in our theatre were reacting to the scares and it was entertaining, makes a pretty good date night movie if your in the mood for a horror flick.",premise potential cool original idea movie start pretty cool nice little mystery start follow familiar formula seems like writer either never watched ring decided rip jump scare creepy trailer made sadly watched follows ring fallen pretty much watched one even though movie fresh hoped still enjoyable people theatre reacting scare entertaining make pretty good date night movie mood horror flick

"One of the most unsettling horror movies of 2022 with shades of ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" premise is ""Smile"".The films score is edgy like nails, Nine Inch Nails that is, or on a chalk board in a scene from ""Jaws"" and cranks up to volume eleven for maximum impact when the horror levels rise from 1 to 10 like a pain threshold metre for your ears.I kept waiting for a surprise or twist, but there wasn't one even though it felt like it was building to one.Making the ending very predictable.Still I liked how ""Smile"" sensitively handled mental illness and even frowned on one of the investigating policeman for his complete lack of empathy towards patients.In ""Smile"" you can witness a normally sane, educated woman's slide into mental illness and they make it believable and that in itself is scary...even when you strip away the Supernatural elements.How far are any of us from falling into the dark depths of the Black Dog?One trope I'd love to see removed from Horror screenplays like this is when a character opens the fridge door, looks inside the fridge, then shuts the fridge door...all the while making film goers think maybe there's something behind the fridge door waiting, but there never is anymore.In fact, there are more than one second hand scenario playing out in ""Smile"" and that's one of its weaknesses...along with the stereotypical boyfriend who won't support, listen or understand his lovers slippery slide into madness.""Smile"" is not even the first horror movie to use this title.There was another back in 2009 starring Armand Assante.Plenty of jump scares in just under 2 hours, just ask the guys who were sitting behind me in the cinema screening on opening night as they gave a running commentary throughout the movie...that never gets old.Watch out for: Kevin Keppy as ""Nightmare Mum"". So, imagine Marilyn Manson was your mum and you'll get the vibe.Also normally comic actor Kal Penn as the head Doctor running the hospital where the movie's second kill is played out.The producers say: ""Once you see it, it's too late.""I say: The Upside Down photography is too much, too little, too late!It's all been done before.""Smile"" is a mind worm that will bury itself inside the hollow of your skull.",one unsettling horror movie shade grudge ring premise smile film score edgy like nail nine inch nail chalk board scene jaw crank volume eleven maximum impact horror level rise like pain threshold metre ear kept waiting surprise twist one even though felt like building one making ending predictable still liked smile sensitively handled mental illness even frowned one investigating policeman complete lack empathy towards patient smile witness normally sane educated woman slide mental illness make believable scary even strip away supernatural element far u falling dark depth black dog one trope love see removed horror screenplay like character open fridge door look inside fridge shuts fridge door making film goer think maybe something behind fridge door waiting never anymore fact one second hand scenario playing smile one weakness along stereotypical boyfriend support listen understand lover slippery slide madness smile even first horror movie use title another back starring armand assante plenty jump scare hour ask guy sitting behind cinema screening opening night gave running commentary throughout movie never get old watch kevin keppy nightmare mum imagine marilyn manson mum get vibe also normally comic actor kal penn head doctor running hospital movie second kill played producer say see late say upside photography much little late done smile mind worm bury inside hollow skull
"I keep seeing mixed reviews for this. I liked it, well let me rephrase- I got something out of it.It was doing very well and really should have and could have had a happy ending, but it veered off right at the last minute. In fact, I would be willing to bet the very end was tacked on in spite of how the script was written.The performances, especially Sosha Bacon, were really pretty good. I'm also unsure why she isn't getting more praise. Another highlight was the effects. Just the right amount of gore.The theme of the movie is heavy handed. Survivor's Guilt is a real thing. And this movie is basically telling us that the guilt will always be there, and we have to figure out how to move forward with our lives. Nothing can be done to rid ourselves of said guilt.The solution to the plot - was right there. Then it went on for another few minutes and ruined it. I won't get into details.I say it's worth a watch.

"I think this was a great concept, but it lacked so much. There's no background story, no explanation how it all started, the ending was cheesy and honestly didn't make much sense. I think they had an opportunity to create something great with it, but they either ran out of ideas half way through or just got lazy. There are some really good scenes, and there are some cheesy ones. Majority of it seems to rely on jump scare though, which is OK, but a little lazy. I'd like to find out the origin of the demon, where did it come from? How it all started and why? So many questions, so little answers.",think great concept lacked much background story explanation started ending cheesy honestly make much sense think opportunity create something great either ran idea half way got lazy really good scene cheesy one majority seems rely jump scare though ok little lazy like find origin demon come started many question little answer
"Thrilling horror without a single boring minute. Good story.All of the actors are doing great. The story is about a chain curse, similar to the movie ""It Follows"". Which is also a great horror thriller.But there are at minimum 2 things that could have been done better:The lead role, Rose, is really, really bad at in explaining her situation to other people, which would be extremely helpful to her. But she fails every time she is trying to tell about her situation to someone else. Despite of the fact that she is a doctor. She is acting weird and helpless, not like a doctor. She can't even explain to her sister that someone else put the dead, missed cat inside the box of the birthday gift of her 7 years old nephew. Nobody believes her. ""no, you must be a lunatic, there is no doubt about that.... "" she can't convince her psychiatrist of the situation she is in either. Seeing things that are real. She can't convince her husband, she can't even make him listen to the entire thing that she is trying to tell him.... after this has happened 5 times in a row, it starts to annoy me.The other thing that could have been done better is avoiding jump-scares. I don't know why movie makers do believe, their viewers enjoy these. It is the easiest and poorest way to get the viewer's adrenaline. Dear filmmakers, jump-scares suck.

"Fun times watching a reasonably fast-paced movie with a little suspense now and then. Trauma will follow you for your entire life and it is quite possible your trauma will impact others around you.It is common for a movie to feature zero likable characters, but it actually worked here. People got to experience the result of their unresolved trauma.It is likely the most realistic part is that traumatized people faced stigma by others, a complete lack of support from those closest, and a lack of help from medical personnel.

"So much goes into making a great horror movie. As much as people complain about jump-scares they have a purpose, which is to create physical tension within you. Smile manages through artful camera angles and moves to create a mental twist as your eyes follow where you are taken through windows to upside down landscapes to create physical tension within you then slaps you in the face with a jump scare.Sound effects and repetitive noises are used which are reminiscent of those used in such movies as The Shining.Bacon carries this movie. Her emotions are palpable.Being a big horror fan it's rare for me to hide my face behind my fingers, but this movies had me doing it.The measure of a good horror to me is whether or not I want to see it again, do I want to own a copy because the way it is made is artfully creative and did it scare the hell out of me.

"Did not know what to expect when I caught this film streaming online. The movie poster with the SMILE is definitely attention grabbing and made me want to see what this film was all about. Wow. Really really good. This genre of film always require a suspension of disbelief, but the plot is pulled off very well. The acting is strong throughout the film (well maybe except for the fiance who was a little phony), but Sosie Bacon was a revelation. She was awesome in the role and carries the story throughout without a hitch. There are plenty of jump scares (which is hardly a criticism). I was startled many times during the film. The concept of the creepy smiles is so good in its simplicity. Who could imagine making a horror thriller about them. But they did and it was one of the best films I saw this year.

"From the get go, you know this movie has no happy ending. Like similar ""chain"" theme movies, the ""entity"" in Smile moves from person to person after creating havoc and mayhem in each victims life. And when ever you see a cat or a dog in such a horror film these days you know it's gonna die. I hate that.This film was formulaic and dreary. Some attempt is made at creating sympathy for the female protagonist but ultimately we're just waiting for her to be offed.. because we know too well how the formula ends. Still the movie offers enough obligatory gore and jump scares to create a sufficient mood of dread, but I find myself dreading watching this debacle, not the demise of the characters.Another thing I find amusing is the use of dreary blue in the sets. The ""heroine"" ( victim , patsy , what do you call a character you know is doomed? ) lives in a modern, expensive yet bleak blue on blue black and grey house that is hardly a home. It has about as much personality as the characters themselves. It's like an Airbnb that they rented because they saw it advertised as perfect for a horror movie. And so many movies today use gloomy blues and greys to create a sense of dread. It's like they have one set designer that goes from studio to studio bringing the same portfolio of the same overused ideas. Really after the pet gets killed I was done with this film, though I will say the reveal about the pets death is pretty traumatic. But, why? Really what does it help to establish other than the fact again that the people in this ""chain"" are all doomed. Just why is that entertaining? Do people in general identify with that? If so, what does that say about the world we all have created? I dunno. Maybe these are questions I don't want answered.",get go know movie happy ending like similar chain theme movie entity smile move person person creating havoc mayhem victim life ever see cat dog horror film day know gonna die hate film formulaic dreary attempt made creating sympathy female protagonist ultimately waiting offed know well formula end still movie offer enough obligatory gore jump scare create sufficient mood dread find dreading watching debacle demise character another thing find amusing use dreary blue set heroine victim patsy call character know doomed life modern expensive yet bleak blue blue black grey house hardly home much personality character like airbnb rented saw advertised perfect horror movie many movie today use gloomy blue grey create sense dread like one set designer go studio studio bringing portfolio overused idea really pet get killed done film though say reveal pet death pretty traumatic really help establish fact people chain doomed entertaining people general identify say world created dunno maybe question want answered

"An absolutely awful filmPredictable, insulting, irritating, and relies so hard on ""fake out"" scenesFirst, this kind of ""commentary"" on mental health actually does more harm than good for people who suffer with mental illness. It was offensive from beginning to end how everyone spoke about the mentally ill and people who have mental breaks. Even the MC's therapist. As someone who struggles with mental illness, this movie was triggering.Secondly, no movie that kills a cat or dog without it being directly for character development is good. None. It's an easy death that doesn't require developing a character or mourning.This movie copies off the premise of it follows but expects the reactions of the babadook.

"What does ""Smile"" have in common with similar and equally successful horror movies of recent years, such as ""Mama"", ""Lights Out"", and ""The Babadook""? It also is a full-length adaptation of a short film. And, like the other three, the short was apparently so good that the until now unknown and relatively inexperienced director got offered the chance to direct himself. In the other cases, it worked out very positively. Andy Muschietti of ""Mama"" went on making the acclaimed ""It"" movies, David F. Sandberg of ""Lights Out"" is scoring big with ""Shazam!"", and Jennifer Kent made the beautiful ""The Nightingale"" after ""The Babadook"". Let's hope that ""Smile"" will open important Hollywood doors for Parker Finn as well.I daresay Finn deserves it. ""Smile"" isn't the perfect horror debut, but it's a tense and solid movie with a continuously macabre atmosphere and quite a few effectively terrifying moments (although most of them feature in the trailer already). The plot deals with a sinister curse that drives perfectly normal people to commit suicide with a big juicy smile on their faces. And, like the expression says, smiling is contagious and hence the witness to the suicide of the last person inherits the curse. Via a hysterical patient at her clinic, the curse gets transferred to psychiatrist Rose Cotter, and she knows a thing or two about suicide ever since her traumatizing childhood.""Smile"" is obviously meant to appeal to a younger generation of horror/thriller fans, but it has the ability to nevertheless sufficiently please the elderly and more old-fashioned genre buffs. There's gore, freaky stuff (the birthday party is splendid) and a shocking climax, but on the other hand it's also very predictable and following the well-known and derivative horror patterns (nobody believes the heroine, hallucinations, the search for the one survivor, etc.). There are slightly too many dull and dragging moments, which is inevitable - I guess - in case of short films turning into full features.",smile common similar equally successful horror movie recent year mama light babadook also full length adaptation short film like three short apparently good unknown relatively inexperienced director got offered chance direct case worked positively andy muschietti mama went making acclaimed movie david f sandberg light scoring big shazam jennifer kent made beautiful nightingale babadook let hope smile open important hollywood door parker finn well daresay finn deserves smile perfect horror debut tense solid movie continuously macabre atmosphere quite effectively terrifying moment although feature trailer already plot deal sinister curse drive perfectly normal people commit suicide big juicy smile face like expression say smiling contagious hence witness suicide last person inherits curse via hysterical patient clinic curse get transferred psychiatrist rose cotter know thing two suicide ever since traumatizing childhood smile obviously meant appeal younger generation horror thriller fan ability nevertheless sufficiently please elderly old fashioned genre buff gore freaky stuff birthday party splendid shocking climax hand also predictable following well known derivative horror pattern nobody belief heroine hallucination search one survivor etc slightly many dull dragging moment inevitable guess case short film turning full feature
"It starts with an interesting premise, which carries on through to some reasonable jump scares and a nicely curated unease. And there's a nice allegory with the experience of trauma. But the ending, the ending undoes the whole film. So sitting here, thinking back on what we watched, the memory is focused on that ending. And it is bad enough to undermine all the work that was put in with a strong cast, decent production and what could have been a well-rounded horror. It's not worth watching.

I was in tears cackling like a madman.It was supposed to be creepy, and it was. Still for whatever reason I registered it as comedy. I've spent the last day or so just getting over a high Coronavirus fever. Maybe it made me goofy.Either way, I liked this movie. The acting was good. The idea was original, finally something different in Horror. The score was very important and made an impact on the scenes. This is a must see for anyone who likes scary movies.I think it could have ran a little shorter. It felt kind of drawn-out in parts where nothing really happens. The film builds momentum and lets it rest too long while it fades off.Additionally I was disappointed by the design of the creature/entity/what have you. Totally generic.

"Smile has plenty of wild scares and amazing acting carrying it through most of it's runtime but once it got to it's final act, it lost steam. While the movie was already riding the wave of the ""curse"" trope like The Ring, The Grudge, It Follows etc., it also had the ""trauma"" trope added into it that's usually found in your standard A24 movie (it also adds all the same camera movements seen in an Ari Aster film). The trauma aspect added some momentum to the character and gave some explanation to why people may think she's crazy, but it didn't do much for me. It just made the movie feel way more derivative by the end. In my opinion, the ending also felt very anticlimactic. The characters talk about how you need to kill someone to end the curse and they briefly show something that alludes to that but nothing is ever really done with it. Instead, they end it with the main character taking her life whilst smiling. As I said, it left me feeling kinda empty and upset that they didn't do more with the concept. Overall, it was a serviceable horror movie that I don't regret seeing.C+",smile plenty wild scare amazing acting carrying runtime got final act lost steam movie already riding wave curse trope like ring grudge follows etc also trauma trope added usually found standard movie also add camera movement seen ari aster film trauma aspect added momentum character gave explanation people may think crazy much made movie feel way derivative end opinion ending also felt anticlimactic character talk need kill someone end curse briefly show something alludes nothing ever really done instead end main character taking life whilst smiling said left feeling kinda empty upset concept overall serviceable horror movie regret seeing c
"""Dr. Rose Cotter"" (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the ""Azazel"" theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander.

Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort.

Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me.

"*Note* I'm unsure if it's worth mentioning that I struggle with diagnosed anxiety. Still, it feels relevant, given that it influenced my feelings and thus my subsequent opinion of the film.Smile was an alarming and often unnerving illustration of trauma. Throughout the film, I found myself, at times, unable to look at the screen, my ears pinched in fear of whatever was about to transpire. In truth, by the end of the film, I practically disassociated with where I was. This feeling was likely a byproduct of how engrossed I was with the movie (albeit with my hoodie pulled nearly over my eyes).I don't wish to give away the plot, so I won't, but I would encourage most to watch this film. I haven't slept comfortably for days, and although for many, that might be a deterrent from watching, I think it's a testament to why you should see the film. Any movie worth watching should elicit a feeling, not a momentary one, but one that lingers, one that you tell your friends about or one that you quietly think about to yourself, but regardless, one that doesn't leave your mind.This film meets this mark and exceeds it with a cohesive storyline, a chilling soundtrack, and overall good performances from its lead cast. Bravo.",note unsure worth mentioning struggle diagnosed anxiety still feel relevant given influenced feeling thus subsequent opinion film smile alarming often unnerving illustration trauma throughout film found time unable look screen ear pinched fear whatever transpire truth end film practically disassociated feeling likely byproduct engrossed movie albeit hoodie pulled nearly eye wish give away plot would encourage watch film slept comfortably day although many might deterrent watching think testament see film movie worth watching elicit feeling momentary one one lingers one tell friend one quietly think regardless one leave mind film meet mark exceeds cohesive storyline chilling soundtrack overall good performance lead cast bravo
"""Smile"" is a very clever horror movie interlacing an intriguing story, good acting, and a fantastic concept. Comparable to Wes Craven's New Nightmare, It Follows, and Sinister, writer/director Parker Finn borrows from so much, he makes the movie its own.We start with Dr. Rose Cotter, a psychiatrist who works tirelessly for mental patients in a hospital. She must deal with a college student brought in who have severe trauma from witnessing a suicide a several days ago. The girl was seeing visions of people with an evil smile, and she is worried something is after her. She then smiles and kills herself in front of Rose.Now Rose begins her descent into madness. She starts experiencing the same thing. They are little at first, but grow in frequency, confusing her reality. She did have her own trauma as a child, and it seems to feed on it.Rose eventually alienates everyone with her mental breakdown: her sister, her fiancÃ©, her supervisor, and her mentor. It pushes her to the brink of being alone, except for a former boyfriend who is a cop. They do some investigation which leads to a revelation of an entity linked to all the evil things happening.The movie is so effective on several levels. It relies on jump scares accented with a haunting and disturbing soundtrack. Both were done so well, it might take ten minutes after the movie to calm down (it certainly affected me in that way). Unique camera angles and walking daydream sequences bend reality, confusing the audience to no end.Finally, ""Smile"" has an allegorical statement of how trauma robs a person of their dignity, warps reality, and affects the deepest parts of our soul. Is this an evil being, or just her trauma she shares with others?",smile clever horror movie interlacing intriguing story good acting fantastic concept comparable wes craven new nightmare follows sinister writer director parker finn borrows much make movie start dr rose cotter psychiatrist work tirelessly mental patient hospital must deal college student brought severe trauma witnessing suicide several day ago girl seeing vision people evil smile worried something smile kill front rose rose begin descent madness start experiencing thing little first grow frequency confusing reality trauma child seems feed rose eventually alienates everyone mental breakdown sister fianc supervisor mentor push brink alone except former boyfriend cop investigation lead revelation entity linked evil thing happening movie effective several level relies jump scare accented haunting disturbing soundtrack done well might take ten minute movie calm certainly affected way unique camera angle walking daydream sequence bend reality confusing audience end finally smile allegorical statement trauma robs person dignity warp reality affect deepest part soul evil trauma share others
"With so many possession movies out there it is becoming increasingly difficult adding a fresh spin on the genre. 'Smile' does just that. It's puts a new twist on an overly familiar genre.I've seen my share of possession movies - some are incredibly well made, some are downright awful, and then there are those hovering somewhere in the middle; not memorable nor terrible. With the hype surrounding 'Smile' I was curious, but also feared it could be similar to 'It Follows' - a film that was praised, but which I found utterly ridiculous.Fortunately, 'Smile' is definitely one of the better possession films. What works well here, are the creepy visuals, and the character set-up. The film's lead is Rose Cotter, who is a therapist in a psychiatric ward. Her daily life revolves around treating people who are traumatized and delusional. So when things start going wrong for Rose, we know exactly how those around her must view her.Her ordeal starts after seeing a patient who was witness to a horrible suicide. When this patient commits suicide in front of her in a hysterical rage, Rose's life becomes a living nightmare. Sosie Bacon (Kevin Bacon's daughter) delivers a fantastic performance as Rose Cotter.In the vein of 'The Ring' the film becomes more interesting when Rose tries to unravel the mystery, with time running out for herself. Apart from being a creepy horror, it also served so well as a mystery thriller, and it reeled me in hook, line and sinker. I was captivated. The film also allows for excellent character development. The jump scares are super effective.This is one of those movies where saying too much will result in spoilers, and this is a film you definitely have to experience for yourself - providing you're into this genre, off course. Although I did see the ending from a mile away, it was still a nerve-wrecking and exciting journey. 'Smile' exceeded my expectations in every way. I loved it.The ending screams for a sequel, and with the film's enormous box office success, no doubt it will materialize.",many possession movie becoming increasingly difficult adding fresh spin genre smile put new twist overly familiar genre seen share possession movie incredibly well made downright awful hovering somewhere middle memorable terrible hype surrounding smile curious also feared could similar follows film praised found utterly ridiculous fortunately smile definitely one better possession film work well creepy visuals character set film lead rose cotter therapist psychiatric ward daily life revolves around treating people traumatized delusional thing start going wrong rose know exactly around must view ordeal start seeing patient witness horrible suicide patient commits suicide front hysterical rage rose life becomes living nightmare sosie bacon kevin bacon daughter delivers fantastic performance rose cotter vein ring film becomes interesting rose try unravel mystery time running apart creepy horror also served well mystery thriller reeled hook line sinker captivated film also allows excellent character development jump scare super effective one movie saying much result spoiler film definitely experience providing genre course although see ending mile away still nerve wrecking exciting journey smile exceeded expectation every way loved ending scream sequel film enormous box office success doubt materialize
"Smile (2022) :
Movie Review -Parker Finn's scary horror thriller will take the Smile off your face and fill it with fear. The horror genre is changing. Wherever you hear this, just remember that there are directors like Parker Finn who are trying hard to take this horror genre to the next level. Smile is a chilling horror thriller with all the possible jumpscares and disturbing moments any modern horror film can provide. It becomes even better with the help of brilliant support from the technical team. Support may be the wrong word; let's replace it with 'Boost'. Has any low-budget horror thriller looked so scary in recent times (of course, excluding Paranormal Activity)? I don't think so. Finn has actually put The Conjuring universe to shame by making a technically solid film like Smile on a lesser budget than whatever its producers have spent on it. Paramount should give Parker Finn another chance, and this time with a higher budget (from the huge profits they made from Smile), and I am damn sure he will do wonders with his excellent vision. He knows how to create a real horror thriller with a gripping storyline and extremely engaging storytelling. Not a moment in Smile where you can lose your interest. Even the weakest of scenes have such a strong grip on you as a viewer. Even if the girl is silent, you get scared because the background score is so buzzing and atmospheric. I literally bumped into my brother's pillow, who was sleeping beside me. That scare, that startling.. Oh God. Yes, a little bit of quivering was missing there. Nevertheless, Smile still looks good as a complete horror package with solid acts, crisp writing, a haunting screenplay, a chilling score, and amazing direction. Believe me, modern horror can't get better than this on this budget. It can only get bigger and scarier if want to.RATING - 6.5/10*",smile movie review parker finn scary horror thriller take smile face fill fear horror genre changing wherever hear remember director like parker finn trying hard take horror genre next level smile chilling horror thriller possible jumpscares disturbing moment modern horror film provide becomes even better help brilliant support technical team support may wrong word let replace boost low budget horror thriller looked scary recent time course excluding paranormal activity think finn actually put conjuring universe shame making technically solid film like smile lesser budget whatever producer spent paramount give parker finn another chance time higher budget huge profit made smile damn sure wonder excellent vision know create real horror thriller gripping storyline extremely engaging storytelling moment smile lose interest even weakest scene strong grip viewer even girl silent get scared background score buzzing atmospheric literally bumped brother pillow sleeping beside scare startling oh god yes little bit quivering missing nevertheless smile still look good complete horror package solid act crisp writing haunting screenplay chilling score amazing direction believe modern horror get better budget get bigger scarier want rating

All the time I was thinking ""come on, is this a joke?"".The whole thing seemed like a vague idea in someone's head, that was never really thought out fully.

"This movie without a doubt was entertaining, it just was not the most original thing I have ever seen...It starts off throwing you right into the action and is quite scary and thrilling. It keeps an ok pace throughout, however I definitely think it could have been trimmed down a bit to help the flow of action and run time. Regardless it was still thrilling and kept me interested despite its parallels to many other horror movies, edging it into the generic realm.I loved a lot of technical aspects of this movie. The way it was shot and edited, the sound design, the special effects... it all added greatly to its success. The acting on the other hand was spotty. The main girl did a good job, probably the best job, and so did her ex. Everyone else was.... Idk, they felt very not seasoned and silted (the boyfriend probably being the worst of the bunch).I wish Smile could have thrown something else original into the mix that made it feel less derivative of other movies. I feel the unoriginality along with some poor acting stoped this from reaching a 7 for me but it was close in a lot of other ways. Would recommend.",movie without doubt entertaining original thing ever seen start throwing right action quite scary thrilling keep ok pace throughout however definitely think could trimmed bit help flow action run time regardless still thrilling kept interested despite parallel many horror movie edging generic realm loved lot technical aspect movie way shot edited sound design special effect added greatly success acting hand spotty main girl good job probably best job ex everyone else idk felt seasoned silted boyfriend probably worst bunch wish smile could thrown something else original mix made feel le derivative movie feel unoriginality along poor acting stoped reaching close lot way would recommend
"If you take Oculus, the Ring, and It Follows and mix them up, this is the movie that would be the result. Most of the film is pretty good in suspense in the mind twisting way that I like. But the end is a letdown. They went for a big flashy special effects ending, which ruined it in my opinion. Before that, they were using just enough CGI to keep it interesting. But, as with the appearance of the ghost in the remake of The Haunting, a big bad CGI spirit/demon/whatever doesn't always add to a film.The acting was OK. Nothing to write home about. The best part of the film is following how the story unfolds up until the last 20 minutes.If you can see this movie relatively cheap, it's worth watching once. It's not one that I would recommend buying, though.",take oculus ring follows mix movie would result film pretty good suspense mind twisting way like end letdown went big flashy special effect ending ruined opinion using enough cgi keep interesting appearance ghost remake haunting big bad cgi spirit demon whatever always add film acting ok nothing write home best part film following story unfolds last minute see movie relatively cheap worth watching one would recommend buying though
"This movie was one hell of a surprise. From the trailer it look like it was going to be a nice decent generic horror movie , so i went into this not expecting much. My god was I shocked at what I was witnessing . The scares were effective enough to make the whole audience scream and cry at certain points. It also had a nice message about how people deal with trauma.This movie was well paced, some might say it was a bit slow but I thought it was perfect.

"A recent horror film from earlier this year starring Sosie Bacon (Kevin & Kyra Sedgwick's daughter). Bacon is a psychologist, overworked & about to marry her beau, Jesse T. Usher, but then a late slotted patient comes into her orbit claiming to see a menacing figure pursuing her, which no one sees, sending her into hysterics. Bacon does her best to calm her down but then a rictus like grin appears on her face right before the patient kills herself in front of her in a grisly manner. Shaken to her core, Bacon starts to see visions of her own which prompts her, lazily, do conduct an investigation into why the girl took her life along w/Kyle Gallner, a cop she used to date which allows her relationship w/Usher & her sister, Gillian Zinser, to suffer. A breakthrough occurs when Bacon finds out the victim actually witnessed someone else commit suicide & so on & so on (much like the evil videotape in The Ring where one person watches the vile imagery then passes it onto another, etc.) which leads to a predictable ending & not much character growth to be found. Heralded as a huge hit, 200 million worldwide, this film is emblematic of the type of horror films which score w/mainstream audiences but when the average person takes a look under its hood, there isn't much there, there w/shocks telegraphed way ahead of schedule, a heroine who's used like a ragdoll at the whim of the narrative & the typical surrounding players (like Dev Patel, Rob Morgan, etc.) who don't believe the lead even though something is obviously going on.

"Creepy enough, in the beginning: an effective psychological horror. Unfortunately, as this wears on, or feels more and more derivative. The most obvious comparison, to me, was the Japanese film trilogy, ""Ringu"", of which ""Smile"" feels almost like an adaptation or a variation on a theme.The main character's descent into insanity is portrayed effectively enough, but the big reveal (when the ""monster"" is shown on-screen) is, as is usually the case, a big disappointment and almost laughable.Points are scored here for the relatively unknown cast, and for the atmosphere of unease created in the first half of the film, due in no small part to the main setting in an emergency psychiatric hospital - but overall, it's not particularly original or (ultimately) scary.",creepy enough beginning effective psychological horror unfortunately wear feel derivative obvious comparison japanese film trilogy ringu smile feel almost like adaptation variation theme main character descent insanity portrayed effectively enough big reveal monster shown screen usually case big disappointment almost laughable point scored relatively unknown cast atmosphere unease created first half film due small part main setting emergency psychiatric hospital overall particularly original ultimately scary
"I think while this movie could have passed on the last 15 minutes or so, the whole movie before that was very interesting tow watch as this woman went from everyday normal, to a raving lunatic in just under 1 hour of movie time.You had to feel for her in this. She's a doctor and just goes off the deep end. You sort of sit there, while having a few decent jump scares, and really feel like you just want to get back to the focus on her character.I love a good, quality movie that shows you someone's spiral into madness, and you know simply by the plot that not only is that happening, she actually has a real problem with this entity thing.If you enjoy watching someone come unglued, this is great! One of the things that bothered me was that her fianc√© was there, and then suddenly he just wasn't anymore. I know they sort of give you a ""breakup"" thought, but they never really do and he's just gone. Kind of weird.The last 15 minutes or so...pass.

"I'd never heard of the lead actress, Sosie Bacon before but she's terrific in this. However, the first indication there's no decent plot in any movie is the cheap jump scares and this movie is nothing but. And the lead character makes some nonsense choices. She's alone in the house, she hears a voice so she makes the decision to turn off all the lights and go to bed. Then in the next scene it's suddenly the next day and the jump scare is her almost getting hit by a car. I had enough after that and turned it off.

I'm sitting here typing this review in the final 20 minutes because I couldn't care less how this movie ends.Not only that, it relies heavily on jump scares in the first half to create ""fear"".All in all, the story lacks depth.

"Such ambitious and exploratory notions require supreme proficiency in writing; a slight misstep could very much turn out to be detrimental. Unfortunately, in this case, there is not one but many missteps have been taken, as a result, not only does the narrative make less of an impression here, the overall outcome too leaves a big room for improvement.Where do I even begin? The inept script? Or the poorly jotted-down characters? (Except for our main lead, Rose, thank goodness) or should I start our dialogue with those pretentious, at times, utter ridiculous sequences in which the creators tried too hard to generate fear but instead made a mockery out of each one of them?I may sound a bit too harsh with my criticisms and I probably am, however, some things did help me ease my feelings of discontentment.One of which was the lead performance, deftly delivered by Sosie Bacon, her enactment, her mere presence brought along much-needed credibility and conviction. The Cinematography and the work with the Sound were fine as well!It's the writing however, where the film seemed to have struggled the most.Although make no mistake, this is not a horrible movie by any means, matter of fact, this does perform nicely, albeit to a certain extent.

"I rarely write reviews but this movie has two things of note that make me want to write one.This is the most well-directed debut horror I have seen since Julia Ducournau's Raw. I have no idea who Parker Finn is, but I cannot wait to see his next movie. Fluid camera work, razor sharp compositions , and he sure knows how to create a tense set up. After some over-reliance on jump scares in the first half the movie picks up momentum and carries it to the finish line with a whopper of an ending.The second is Sosie Bacon. The best performance I have seen in a horror movie since Toni Collette in Hereditary, and maybe even better than Collette. If acting is using your body and face to create realism in the character then this is an Oscar-level performance. Of course movies like this are ignored, but I challenge you to find a better performance from a no-name, ever.I gained more and more appreciation for this movie the longer it went on. That is no easy feat, much less for a first time director.The only negative is that it isn't really scary in a bone-chilling way; you can't help but react to jump scares when they are set up well, but that doesn't make a movie scary for me. This isn't The Conjuring or The Exorcist.

"I caught Chris Stuckmann's review of this, and I'm glad I did. There's nothing particularly original, but what is here, is really, really well done. The thing I have to mention first is the music and sound design - it's the kind that actually takes the movie up another level, and incredibly creepy. Makes me think of 'Under Her Skin'.The director is not afraid to take his time with long and static shots - and he does them well. There are some great camera shots - and some of the kind that make you think ""how did he do that?"". And good performances all round, particularly from Sosie Bacon (Kevin Bacon's daughter...) - she really does put a lot of energy and emotion into her character, I really felt for her. You know that situation where everyone just thinks they are mad, but WE know she's not - you get frustrated and upset for the character on screen, and that's good acting right there.Towards the ending it took a bit of an odd turn, but nothing that spoiled the movie. It was nearly 2 hours long, but to be fair, it didn't feel too long, even for a horror flick.Anyway, if you like your horror, then you will love this, for sure. But it is a good movie period.

"(Spoilers ahead, also take this with a grain of salt, I found it scary) It was a good movie and I'd love to watch it again. It's definitely some sort of new way to present the (a tad overused) concept of smiles being seen as creepy. A bit too much jumpscares to my liking and despite some of them being super predictable, every single one made me jump in my chair (the best jumpscare in my opinion was the can of cat food opening). There is literally not a moment to rest while watching this, there's always tension building up to something. Rose being treated as crazy and no one trying to help or believe her was such a distressing and frustrating concept. Every person that should have helped Rose just distanced themselves from her without even trying to understand her. Even though I really liked the movie it definitely has its flaws which a lot of people seem to overlook. The ending was such a disappointment and it wasn't fulfilling at all, although it gives hope for a sequel (fingers crossed). The CGI features, especially the entity were unnecessary and honestly really cheesy, the mother was a lot scarier before she ""evolved"" (?) and I think that keeping the Smile in a human form would be a lot more disturbing. Some scenes made me laugh, some had me crying, I went on a whole ass emotional rollercoaster there but all in all it was probably one of the best horror movies I've seen. The acting was absolutely amazing.

"Smile has its derivative elements within the premise and the ending feels cheap but it's still a really good horror that for the most part, succeeds at making its central idea unsettling and scary rather than silly and unintentionally funny.Sosie Bacon gives an incredible lead performance that makes the trauma she goes through even more horrifying to watch. Jessie T. Usher, Kal Penn and Kyle Gallner are all good with their simple supporting roles.Parker Finn's direction is great, there's plenty of tension, unsettling imagery that lingers after the credits and jump scares are really well employed.

"Smile is awful. Just got back from watching this film. I don't see what positive things people are seeing. Some shots are nice, but it gets to the point where it's far too noticeable to see that the director really wanted you to notice their """"""artistry"""""". There's one shot of the monster that's really cool but it's quickly thrown away and wasted on a film like this. This movie is filled to the brim with cliches. Not even in a fun way, not in so bad it's good way, just terrible. I knew exactly what was gonna happen like 10 minutes before it even actually happened. Honestly might be the film with the most horror cliches I've ever seen.

"Okay let's get this over with. So Rose is a psychologist who had a traumatic experience with her mother when she was a kid. Now after one of her patients kills herself right in front of Rose while creepily smiling, an evil entity latches on to her and torments her mind making her seem crazy. Now she has to figure out how to get rid of it or succumb to her demise.You know I thought this was gonna be a stinker just from how obnoxious the marketing was. I swear I saw the trailers for this movie everywhere, posters all over the place, and those actors at baseball games creepily smiling at the cameras. I guess they really wanted you to immerse you in this movie and experience the horror of the protagonist felt. Well in a way I did get that feeling. This movie is a horrible movie and I'd like to be rid of its presence myself.It's obnoxious in its execution of scares constantly using annoying musical cues for jump scares that are usually more goofy than frightening. And it hardly ever stops to give you a breath or give you something interesting in between the scares, like a good movie does. It's poorly written and half of the cast phones in their performances. The video editing and cinematography also follows the same points the sound editing and mixing. It's all just so obnoxious and uncomfortable. I honestly felt headaches and nausea half the time while watch this movie.Is it ironic to say this movie doesn't bring a smile to my face? I feel like I'm gonna need a shrink after this so I can forget I ever saw this movie. I mean in all honesty I probably will forgettable it anyways. It's bad and forgettable, but when you watch it, you'd wish you never did. I'm exhausted just thinking about it. Maybe I can get the Salem Sisters to help me forget about Smile.

"Smile has good cinematography, great sound design, great acting, and a good script that keeps you entertained. However, I expected this movie to lean into the uncanny valley a little bit, considering that the premise is built on a sinister uncanny smile. Instead the scares in this movie are mostly just predictable jump scares. The only scare I thought was somewhat effective was basically a retread of the grandma ghost from Hereditary. Along with this, the third act to the film is problematic. This happens to a LOT of horror movies built on the ideas of a curse like The Ring, where there is an obvious solution but the protagonist doesn't reach it out of stupidity, and the ending, while certainly unexpected, wasn't very satisfyingly and it was honestly abrupt. The entire third act was overly long and didn't make much sense, along with some annoying CGI.Overall, I hope this director gets to make a less-generic project that is perhaps a little more scary because I really liked the direction and look of this film. High praise to the director here, not as much to the screenwriter.",smile good cinematography great sound design great acting good script keep entertained however expected movie lean uncanny valley little bit considering premise built sinister uncanny smile instead scare movie mostly predictable jump scare scare thought somewhat effective basically retread grandma ghost hereditary along third act film problematic happens lot horror movie built idea curse like ring obvious solution protagonist reach stupidity ending certainly unexpected satisfyingly honestly abrupt entire third act overly long make much sense along annoying cgi overall hope director get make le generic project perhaps little scary really liked direction look film high praise director much screenwriter
"This was a really easy movie to watch. It hooked me in right away and almost never dragged. I was impressed with how good a job it did at creeping me out. I probably should have hated this movie because the main character was insufferable. No matter how messed up things get, she refuses to do anything but say that she's fine and keep it to herself. Somehow, I got past that, probably because I was so invested in finding out what was going on. I also thought there were some very good effects and makeup, and that the movie was well paced. The filmmakers seemed to know exactly the right time to drop in a shocking moment, and did it better than the vast majority of horror movies. I would rate this one well above average, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the genre.",really easy movie watch hooked right away almost never dragged impressed good job creeping probably hated movie main character insufferable matter messed thing get refuse anything say fine keep somehow got past probably invested finding going also thought good effect makeup movie well paced filmmaker seemed know exactly right time drop shocking moment better vast majority horror movie would rate one well average would recommend anyone interest genre
"First of all, this movie achieves it's purpose to scare you really well. Mostly repetitive jump scares, but they are still effective. So for the horror part, I think it's a good movie.As far as the plot though, that's where this movie kind of loses me. You don't get to know pretty much anything about this great evil. Why 4-7 days? Where did it come from? Why it does what it does? How long is this going on? Honestly, how stupid is the police in this movie, that they don't notice 20+ connected suicides in a short amount of time? Does it need someone with childhood trauma? Can it be killed?You can have a mystery evil, but then there needs to be something else to fill out the movie other than jump scares and a screaming lady. This is just a personal note, but I feel like there is a missed opportunity with the nephew, I thought they were cleverly trying to imply, he might be a next victim in the future, but that didn't really go anywhere.Overall, probably not going to watch it again. It's not bad or anything, there are just better horrors out there.",first movie achieves purpose scare really well mostly repetitive jump scare still effective horror part think good movie far plot though movie kind loses get know pretty much anything great evil day come long going honestly stupid police movie notice connected suicide short amount time need someone childhood trauma killed mystery evil need something else fill movie jump scare screaming lady personal note feel like missed opportunity nephew thought cleverly trying imply might next victim future really go anywhere overall probably going watch bad anything better horror

"When I watched Smile trailer, I thought that it will be a horror movie which is different from the other horror movies that I watched, and when I watched it, what I thought become exactly true.In Smile, everything deserves praise, from the story, to the soundtrack, to the performances of the cast, to the creepy, tense, and frightening atmosphere, to the perfect timed jumpscares, to the mystery and horror elements, to the screenplay, to the direction, to the blood and gore scenes, to the psychological elements that the movie deals with, to the unexpected twist in the ending. Once again, everything deserves praise without any exception.If I want to talk about the flaws, generally, the movie does not have any flaw. But the ""very little thing"" that I didn't like is that the movie did not explain the origins of the supernatural power in it. That is the only little flaw that I noticed, nothing more, nothing less. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Smile 9 out of 10.",watched smile trailer thought horror movie different horror movie watched watched thought become exactly true smile everything deserves praise story soundtrack performance cast creepy tense frightening atmosphere perfect timed jumpscares mystery horror element screenplay direction blood gore scene psychological element movie deal unexpected twist ending everything deserves praise without exception want talk flaw generally movie flaw little thing like movie explain origin supernatural power little flaw noticed nothing nothing le come score gladly give smile
"I'll start by saying this film is The Ring - it's basically the same premise. I say this because The Ring has been my favorite horror film and kicked off my love for horror when I was 12 years old. Regardless of its derivation, man was this movie scary!The tension and scares are crafted so well. I've seen a lot of horror films and it's been a while since I literally had goosebumps in the theater. Are there some cheap jump scares? For sure. But whereas many horror movies of the past just repeat the same tactic and play it out, this keeps it fresh by mixing tension, unsettling visuals, atmosphere, and sound design very skillfully. It comes at you from so many different angles that I was often on edge not knowing what to expect. And the score...man was that score unique, creepy and relentless.The story is an allegory that hit home for me. Thankfully, like many more people today, I am particularly passionate about mental health and appreciate that the deeper fear here is all the awful things than can develop from trauma, the self-perpetuating cycle of mental health illness in a family, and the difficulty in finding how to successfully win against your demons. It wasn't a groundbreaking story, but it was told well.We've been getting some bangers from young new horror directors over the last couple of years (Jordan Peele, Ari Astor, Robert Eggers) and Parker Finn might need to be added to the list. Hope he has more ideas because I'd love to see his next film. It's a renaissance for horror and I'm loving it. Add this to the list of must see for horror fans.",start saying film ring basically premise say ring favorite horror film kicked love horror year old regardless derivation man movie scary tension scare crafted well seen lot horror film since literally goosebump theater cheap jump scare sure whereas many horror movie past repeat tactic play keep fresh mixing tension unsettling visuals atmosphere sound design skillfully come many different angle often edge knowing expect score man score unique creepy relentless story allegory hit home thankfully like many people today particularly passionate mental health appreciate deeper fear awful thing develop trauma self perpetuating cycle mental health illness family difficulty finding successfully win demon groundbreaking story told well getting banger young new horror director last couple year jordan peele ari astor robert egger parker finn might need added list hope idea love see next film renaissance horror loving add list must see horror fan
"The plot of the movie was very innovative, interesting and I was really hyped, because everyone was talking about that movie. The storyline was kinda well-written, of course there were some plot holes and unanswered questions. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. Of course, it was a very scary movie and there were too many jumpscares (most of them, were totally unexpected). The opening scene of the movie was terrifying and very promising. Sadly, the killcount of the movie was low and there weren't many gory kills (only one was really bloody). Also, the casting and the acting of the movie were both really good (Sosie, the main actress was amazing). The ending scene was definitely unexpected and it was really shocking and disturbing. In my opinion, that movie had potential and I would definitely like the idea of a sequel or a prequel! Overall, it was a nice movie, very intense and really creepy. Last but not least, I recommend to anyone, don't watch the trailer of the movie (because, many jumpscares are revealed on the trailer).",plot movie innovative interesting really hyped everyone talking movie storyline kinda well written course plot hole unanswered question character interesting well developed kinda likeable course scary movie many jumpscares totally unexpected opening scene movie terrifying promising sadly killcount movie low many gory kill one really bloody also casting acting movie really good sosie main actress amazing ending scene definitely unexpected really shocking disturbing opinion movie potential would definitely like idea sequel prequel overall nice movie intense really creepy last least recommend anyone watch trailer movie many jumpscares revealed trailer
"This is just a copycat of many of the popular horror movies of the past decade. 30 jump scares, tense music playing for half the movie, and very predictable movie throughout. If you like that type of movie, you will love this, but I personally am bored of these types of movies. I miss the unpredictable horror movies of the late 90s and early 2000s that didn't have as many jump scares. I am referring to the sixth sense, the others, the ring, stir of echoes, etc. I predicted the ending halfway through, and I was annoyed by some of the potholes that were obvious throughout the movie.

To be demon possessed is a real phenomenon ... in this movie this phenomenon is exposed in a 'sensational' way without being explained properly like in the Exorcist. The storyline is very lame and poor ... it would have been much more interesting and informing for the viewer if more background information was added about demonic possession and how to deal with it ... it is no 'laughing matter' and certainly not a subject suitable for cheap and uninspiring entertainment ; a missed opportunity to make a really meaningful movie about this subject in my opinion ... Unfortunately a lot of movies in the occult horror genre do not 'touch' the essential questions related to this subject ...,demon possessed real phenomenon movie phenomenon exposed sensational way without explained properly like exorcist storyline lame poor would much interesting informing viewer background information added demonic possession deal laughing matter certainly subject suitable cheap uninspiring entertainment missed opportunity make really meaningful movie subject opinion unfortunately lot movie occult horror genre touch essential question related subject
"This is not a good film, it is filled with overacting Only teens and adults in their 20's would consider this a good film.I was ready to turn this off on multiple occasions. It tries to be modern and hip like Heriditary(cinematography), and nostalgia with films like The Ring and The Grudge.Some of the score is very similar to Sinister starring Ethan Hawke. Which is far superior to this film.I have no clue as to why Smile is rated so highly. It's nothing but Hollywood's attempt at capturing something that isn't there, nor will it be.It would of worked if it didn't try so hard at being everything else that we have seen before.",good film filled overacting teen adult would consider good film ready turn multiple occasion try modern hip like heriditary cinematography nostalgia film like ring grudge score similar sinister starring ethan hawke far superior film clue smile rated highly nothing hollywood attempt capturing something would worked try hard everything else seen
"Shame that this movie plagiarized a better movie from 1998, called Fallen; Directed by Gregory Hoblit, and starring Denzel Washington, Elias Koteas, Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini and John Goodman. What a list of great actors!Speaking of which, the acting in Fallen was fantastic, and the movie had little to no unnecessary jump scares. While the plot of Fallen was intricate it also referenced religion and the concepts of right and wrong... instead of blaming some curse from Brazil like Smile does.I was not sure why I should cheer for Smile's protagonist instead of the Brazilian curse. I gave it two stars because one of the jump scares was well placed (she was on her headphones) and the final scene was acceptable. The rest was trash and plagiarized.",shame movie plagiarized better movie called fallen directed gregory hoblit starring denzel washington elia koteas donald sutherland james gandolfini john goodman list great actor speaking acting fallen fantastic movie little unnecessary jump scare plot fallen intricate also referenced religion concept right wrong instead blaming curse brazil like smile sure cheer smile protagonist instead brazilian curse gave two star one jump scare well placed headphone final scene acceptable rest trash plagiarized
This movie made me smile and not because it was happy or funny rather it was a horror film that was actually extremely well thought out and executed on and I'm a sucker for horror. They absolutely got this right from the story line to the music/sounds to the appropriate level of gore/violence to the twists and turns. It was a legitimately scary psychological ride that is so clearly fake but seemingly real at the same time.

Prime kept recommending this movie and after ignoring for a long time i took the bait. The most annoying thing about this movie is the acting. Everyone overacts. The lead does it effortlessly. I think it must come from the director because everyone does the same. As a thought the plot must have sounded great but execution of horrible. It has all the cliches of movies which claim they are intelligent horror movies.I think they should make sequels and pass on the curse. The music always feels omnious and then will stop suddenly.

"Sometimes you can't tell why do you fancy or not a certain movie. It just happens. But this is not the case.This is a very curious example of a well crafted horror movie with a good sense of proportion.In one hand we can call it a sub-classic because it really doesn't add any piece to the puzzle of horror history... but for me ""Smile"" hits a very high number of right notes along a sad song of trauma, guilt, powerlessness and mental suffering.To sum it up, if you choose to stay on the cynical team you won't find anything new in this one: every day hard normality turns crazily derranged by a powerful evil force and it absolutely overwhelms a fragile soul... the end. But if you choose to play a little more generous than that you'll be surprised how small moments of the movie can be so original, how jump scares can be so on the spot, an so on.After figuring what's your mood today, maybe you consider to jump aboard and be delighted with this one..",sometimes tell fancy certain movie happens case curious example well crafted horror movie good sense proportion one hand call sub classic really add piece puzzle horror history smile hit high number right note along sad song trauma guilt powerlessness mental suffering sum choose stay cynical team find anything new one every day hard normality turn crazily derranged powerful evil force absolutely overwhelms fragile soul end choose play little generous surprised small moment movie original jump scare spot figuring mood today maybe consider jump aboard delighted one
"After hearing and reading so many positive reviews for the movie, I was too excited for this movie but after watching it I can easily say that it is overrated. It was an average psychological horror flick with not a new story in it. I remember watching this type of story somewhere else. After sometime, I started getting bored. The movie felt dragged and I just wanted it to end with a proper explanation.The performances were normal, direction felt loose, the runtime and pacing was bad.

"Goodness me... I have no words, I genuinely do not understand the positive scores this film is receiving.Let me start with a question, you know that feeling where you're in a packed theater and at the end of the film the audience immediately begins its ""holy crap reactions"" and you're just sitting there thinking ""the hell movie did you guys watch?"" That's Smile for me.This film is boring, cliche, and unimaginative. Like what is this film trying to be? Can't be horror, it's nowhere near scary. Can't be thriller, because it's sure as hell not thrilling. Can't be mystery, because you could see it all coming. Baisc is the only word that comes to mind for this film.The performances were passable at best. I did not care for any characters minus one, Kyle Gallner as Joel he was to me the only likeable character. Everybody else including the protagonist were all boring, the husband Jessie T. Usher as Trevor was the worst. I have no problem with the actor, he was given crap material, and I can't call him a bad actor because I've never seen him in anything else.My recommendation for Smile is hard pass. Don't watch it in theaters, don't rent it in fact maybe don't even watch it! Instead go out and watch Barbarian because that film surpasses this one by miles.IMDb: 3/10

"...but it isn't. It's just another monster movie and A-Train kinda ruined the scary stuff for me. Don't get me wrong, I love his character in The Boys, but seeing him popping up in this one makes me sort of waiting for him to take off in super sonic speed.But there actually are parts that are creeping up on the watcher, it's got a great ambience and it's very well made. It's a rare thing, finding a movie that actually makes one sit on edge now and then these days. You know from start that things are not going to go too well for the protagonist. I do find that research of her profession would've been a good thing though, seeing as I work with the kind of people she's treating and I found that the lack of research for her supposed profession annoyed me a little. Still, that isn't what the movie is about so I guess it's ok nevertheless. I'm just a stickler for details sometimes.But, I have to say, the movie starts out really good. The premise is interesting and as aforementioned, parts of it is indeed very creepy, but as the movie goes on it slowly starts to drop the ball. There aren't many jump scares, but the very few that there is are too many as it cuts the ambience right off every time. Some scenes even made me annoyed; as with the one where Rose is talking to her psychiatrist Madeleine in her living room and it turns out that she's not talking to her but to a vision the entity is showing her. It is a great moment of creepiness, but then the thing starts to talk and ending the scene by grabbing Rose by the throat while drooling like an alien. That ruined the mood completely, as did later scenes where the entity is shown as just another monster. While Rose where backing away from the sofa the entity should've just stayed put, smiling and not having said a word beyond those of Madeleine's until it was out of view. That would've been so much better and it wouldn't have ruined the illusion of terror. Instead she went after Rose, talking with a distorted stereotypical demonic voice and completely ruined the scene. I felt that every time it turned out that Rose interacted with the entity it should've just stopped talking and gone silent with that dead smile on it's face. It should never have talked as itself to Rose,a and it should never have gone into Marilyn Manson monster mode (yes, it looks like some version of Marilyn Manson at the end of the movie).There's an old movie (Fallen) starring Denzel Washington where they successfully did manage to uphold the illusion of the premise. It's not as creepy as this one at first set out to be, but it did work amazingly well and that one is a movie on this 'passing the demon on-theme' done right. That one worked, but this one doesn't.They had the opportunity to create something truly scary, but in the end settled for making just another generic standard monster movie. It's a real shame, it showed so much promise at first. Never show the monster, never let the viewer work things out himself beforehand. Never let the viewer be bored even before the movie ends.Oh well, perhaps there will come a movie that actually delivers on the promised concept, who knows.",another monster movie train kinda ruined scary stuff get wrong love character boy seeing popping one make sort waiting take super sonic speed actually part creeping watcher got great ambience well made rare thing finding movie actually make one sit edge day know start thing going go well protagonist find research profession would good thing though seeing work kind people treating found lack research supposed profession annoyed little still movie guess ok nevertheless stickler detail sometimes say movie start really good premise interesting aforementioned part indeed creepy movie go slowly start drop ball many jump scare many cut ambience right every time scene even made annoyed one rose talking psychiatrist madeleine living room turn talking vision entity showing great moment creepiness thing start talk ending scene grabbing rose throat drooling like alien ruined mood completely later scene entity shown another monster rose backing away sofa entity stayed put smiling said word beyond madeleine view would much better ruined illusion terror instead went rose talking distorted stereotypical demonic voice completely ruined scene felt every time turned rose interacted entity stopped talking gone silent dead smile face never talked rose never gone marilyn manson monster mode yes look like version marilyn manson end movie old movie fallen starring denzel washington successfully manage uphold illusion premise creepy one first set work amazingly well one movie passing demon theme done right one worked one opportunity create something truly scary end settled making another generic standard monster movie real shame showed much promise first never show monster never let viewer work thing beforehand never let viewer bored even movie end oh well perhaps come movie actually delivers promised concept know
"The basic idea of this is not exactly original being so similar to It Follows, but it's well made due to a creative director and other craft people. I think I'm long past anything in film really scaring me. I fear that's mostly for the young, sadly, but this is quite spooky and creepy at times. It also has a good lead actress in Sosie Bacon, someone I'd never heard of. She's gives an honest performance as we watch her slowly deteriorate mentally and in appearance as a therapist in a world of trouble. Kyle Gallner offers decent enough support, but Jessie T. Usher best known for Amazon's The Boys is very lightweight, unconvincing and uninteresting.

"This movie was strongly reminiscent of It Follows. The concept of a person being haunted by an evil entity that no one else can see but them, that can show up as people you know, people who have died. The fact it's passed on from person to person.In contrast, Smile was much creepier. The entity is far more malevolent. It didn't just follow it's victims, it mercilessly tormented them, engaging in cruel trickery to invoke as much fear and anxiety as possible. The filmmakers did a spectacular job drawing you into the reality of the main character. You really feel her terror along with her.There is also just something inherently creepy about people smiling at you in this overly psycho clown type way. Something I realized when watching another great horror film, Hereditary, which featured naked old people smiling at the main characters from dark closets and corners.All in all, this is a very spooky movie and if you're into horror movies and being creeped out, I'd highly recommend it.",movie strongly reminiscent follows concept person haunted evil entity one else see show people know people died fact passed person person contrast smile much creepier entity far malevolent follow victim mercilessly tormented engaging cruel trickery invoke much fear anxiety possible filmmaker spectacular job drawing reality main character really feel terror along also something inherently creepy people smiling overly psycho clown type way something realized watching another great horror film hereditary featured naked old people smiling main character dark closet corner spooky movie horror movie creeped highly recommend
"We've seen multiple movies like ""Smile"" to debut. Smile doesn't have a lot for it to stand out but with its twists and turns and subtle and large scares it makes it stand out from this specific genre of horror.Sosie Backn who plays (Ross Cotter) delivered a great performance and utterly thrilling psychedelic experience. She really went over the top with they acting and made a chilling experience for the viewer.Although they score and camera work could've been better, some scenes felt off putting or confusing. The practical and digital aspects stood out to make a more unique aspect to horror that does not get used. But with all these special aspects it's still a underrated genre that hasn't been fulfilled by the horrifying topic of self hate, trauma, and battling your demons. As far as of now this film is by far the most well done project out of the genre. I will wait til this topic is reborn in a cleaner and smarter way.",seen multiple movie like smile debut smile lot stand twist turn subtle large scare make stand specific genre horror sosie backn play ross cotter delivered great performance utterly thrilling psychedelic experience really went top acting made chilling experience viewer although score camera work could better scene felt putting confusing practical digital aspect stood make unique aspect horror get used special aspect still underrated genre fulfilled horrifying topic self hate trauma battling demon far film far well done project genre wait til topic reborn cleaner smarter way
"Summer is over. The nights are drawing darker, which naturally shifts the mind to the next holiday. Halloween. Strategically this film was released just prior to that. Begging the question....did the producers class this as a horror or is it just mistimed comedy? I fear the latter. And that was my only 'fear' when watching this film. It's a cost of living crisis so the cinema feels like a reckless splurge. I could have had the heating on for 10 minutes instead of watching this film. A shame really. But if you are a Marlyn Manson fan, at least you will be happy as he makes a cameo after about 2 hours of nothing. Maybe the title is ironic for the genre. Or perfect for a comedy? Either-way I'm owed some time back.",summer night drawing darker naturally shift mind next holiday halloween strategically film released prior begging question producer class horror mistimed comedy fear latter fear watching film cost living crisis cinema feel like reckless splurge could heating minute instead watching film shame really marlyn manson fan least happy make cameo hour nothing maybe title ironic genre perfect comedy either way owed time back
"Overly long, tediously boring, not scary, annoying lead actress and excessive jump scares. What could go wrong?The story itself is not that bad but the execution is lazy and unimaginative. It relies on cheap tricks to make the audience jump. An overly loud bang makes you jump but it is hardly frightening.There are a lot better movies out there with a similar premise that are actually scary. One of the things other films do is to make you relate to the lead characters so that when bad stuff happens you actually care.

"In a lot of situations that happened, my thoughts went...yeah but.And it went on getting annoying.Don't get me wrong, the storytelling is very well done.But, for example, if somebody encounters a suicide in front of you. The next day you go to work again?No emotional support by your employer? Some time to put things together?Or on a party, you fall into a glass table...and everyone just stands around and do nothing?That's unreal.And that therapist...and even her friend/husband....
So unrealistic.These kind of things bothered me (there are a few more)
It's just lazy writing imo. They go the easy way.It keeps it all very shallow.And here comes Joel, as her understanding consciousness... how reveling!And after some unexplained hallucinations, the main character goes to her desolated home to face her demon.Which is poorly explained over in a heartbeat.And here comes Joel again...Meh... this movie annoyed me.Just another one that tries to be smart with some lame storytelling.

"That seems to be the take home message after the ridiculous bait and switch where the film would have had a satisfying ending, but instead opted for the annoying sequel setup. The plot is VERY reminiscent of It Follows and Smile doesn't capitalize on the premise as well as that film did.There are elements of this film that really work. The camerawork is top notch, suspense was built well throughout, and the acting is all decent. However, there are some cheap jump scares that overwear their welcome due to the same scare over and over again. There was also a long stretch in the middle where it felt like the plot was not advancing at all.Smile has some good stuff going for it, but ultimately is a mixed bag due to its execution and ending.",seems take home message ridiculous bait switch film would satisfying ending instead opted annoying sequel setup plot reminiscent follows smile capitalize premise well film element film really work camerawork top notch suspense built well throughout acting decent however cheap jump scare overwear welcome due scare also long stretch middle felt like plot advancing smile good stuff going ultimately mixed bag due execution ending

"I don't understand the hype. What is great about this film is the score, sound design and the editing. Some of the sharpest jump cuts I've ever seen. Parker Finn definitely has a good filmmaking career ahead of him. But this story is highly unoriginal. I have seen this movie 1000 times and it's some of the lamest jump scares same as with 1000 other creepy pasta type films. This is basically The Ring without the video tape. Also the cheekiness of calling it Smile and having everyone smiling before they kill themselves was just a little on the nose. As for the filmmaking 8/10 as for the story 2/10. Also the lead actress was pretty good but I can't stand these overhyped films that everyone has seen 1000 times.",understand hype great film score sound design editing sharpest jump cut ever seen parker finn definitely good filmmaking career ahead story highly unoriginal seen movie time lamest jump scare creepy pasta type film basically ring without video tape also cheekiness calling smile everyone smiling kill little nose filmmaking story also lead actress pretty good stand overhyped film everyone seen time

"Smile is a horror film that has succeeded in making the audience surprised many times and feel uncomfortable apart from the story which is quite long-winded. There are many jumpscares that are quite dense, so it feels like it won't fail to make the audience scream hysterically.Rose is a psychiatrist plagued by what she believes to be something supernatural. After a bizarre incident with a patient, she begins to experience inexplicable phenomenons that only she can see.

"I didn't expect much from the movie. I Saw some trailers for it and thought maybe it would be dumb. Figured might as well give it a try because there's not much else to watch. Surprisingly , I really enjoyed it. I didn't realize the lead actress is Kevin Bacon's daughter. I think she did an awesome job . I've never seen her in anything else. The movie has a lot of ""jump scares"" I found myself looking away at certain parts because it was kind of freaky . I haven't seen a really good movie in a long time. This may have been the best I've seen this year. Looking forward to seeing her in other movies. I would probably watch this again

There are near to no deaths, so actions don't have waight.The last monster was cool, at least its face, not much the body, that type of slender man has already being done like 50 times.

"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? Well this ""film"" manages to imitate the concepts of The Ring, It, and even Alien 3 in a shot. The concept of this is ripped off from so many other movies and mashed together so badly, that all I could do was ""smile"" and laugh at how terribly it was executed. If you read other reviews here, people have said the same thing, and even named other movies I haven't seen. Clearly this ""work"" was a ripoff of some of the genres heavy hitters.The writer/director was so amateurish in their execution that I could've sworn it was done by a first timer (turns out, it is their debut full length).This movie is so derivative and comical that I had to laugh at almost everything.

"I've recently stopped watching new movies and TV shows because they are so preachy and with a total cognitive dissonance. However, this one was for quite a while in theatres and I read I wasn't that bad. Well, it's not the worst I've seen, but it's far from good. It's full of plot holes: who killed the cat? How did the curse start? What happened with the mother's dead, did Rose really let her die? And clichés: like the curse that is passed on and you have to find the way to break; aerial takes, the colours, cheap scares, the plot itself is a cliché! It has several post-modernist aspects like the characters seem nihilistic and are pretty unlikable. Actually, the heroine, Rose, I couldn't wait for her to die. You don't care for her at all. Her sister Holly and her brother in-law are actually a little bit worse than her and I was wishing she would pass the curse to them, but didn't. The story fell way too long, it was stretched and stretched, just boring and there is no suspense nor horror. It didn't feel like horror to me, I just wanted her to just die because she was so dum, even from the very beginning (I really don't understand how this unstable woman was treating patients at a hospital!). Finally in the end she immolates herself and passes the curse to Joel, duh. The end is abrupt with him watching her on fire (we don't see her). I guess the director thought it was going to be clever and funny to cut and put on a quirky song like Lollipop (it wasn't original nor witty). All the good parts were on the trailer, so there weren't any surprises. Honestly, I don't recommend it, not even for free or for fun, use your time on something else.",recently stopped watching new movie tv show preachy total cognitive dissonance however one quite theatre read bad well worst seen far good full plot hole killed cat curse start happened mother dead rose really let die clich like curse passed find way break aerial take colour cheap scare plot clich several post modernist aspect like character seem nihilistic pretty unlikable actually heroine rose wait die care sister holly brother law actually little bit worse wishing would pas curse story fell way long stretched stretched boring suspense horror feel like horror wanted die dum even beginning really understand unstable woman treating patient hospital finally end immolates pass curse joel duh end abrupt watching fire see guess director thought going clever funny cut put quirky song like lollipop original witty good part trailer surprise honestly recommend even free fun use time something else

The film has that exciting element which leaves you wondering after its finished to some level. The cast and crew has definitely done justice to the script as best as they can. Apart from all that you get to see cliche stuff of the genere here and there, the jump scare shots, unpleasant longing soundtrack,typical character behaviour and hallucinations put into perspective.

"This is a movie that sort of combines Final Destination with It Follows. There is a creature that follows people, and smiles at them and terrorizes them, and eventually it consumes its victims and makes them kill themselves in front of someone - and then begins to stalk that person. The rules are, the only way to get this thing to stop hunting you is to kill someone in front of a witness so the monster will follow them.Most of Smile's scary moments are seen in the trailer, which was sort of disappointing. But the overall pace and suspense of the film was decent - and the performance by the main character is good enough to hold the show together.Mostly the film is missing a satisfactory final act, but by no stretch is the final act bad or a let down...just could have done little bit more and more confrontation with the monster.Smile is recommended for anyone who likes horror and monster films - not great but certainly watchable and entertaining.",movie sort combine final destination follows creature follows people smile terrorizes eventually consumes victim make kill front someone begin stalk person rule way get thing stop hunting kill someone front witness monster follow smile scary moment seen trailer sort disappointing overall pace suspense film decent performance main character good enough hold show together mostly film missing satisfactory final act stretch final act bad let could done little bit confrontation monster smile recommended anyone like horror monster film great certainly watchable entertaining
"Bacon is very good. In fact the cast is the best part of the film. The script was derivative and silly and there were, like, four endings tacked onto each other for, reasons? The final chase down the hall where the monster disappears is so 'seen it before a thousand times' that when it reappeared behind the hero I laughed. It like the writr/director put a bunch of previous movies in a blender and created this. The image of the creepy smile was great-but the script couldn't keep up, or pay off, that image. Too bad. Maybe with a script he didn't write himself the director might do better.

"I see some reviews mention generic, which is kinda the norm in horrors, it's not particularly easy to create something truly unique and I bet even when you think one is, there will be another with a similar theme, I feel this is a modern version of the ring, but with a very important underlying message.Mental health is a huge point of tension in society, it's brave when films use it as a part of the plot as it has the potential to affect people. There's a misconception that because people tweet and instagram and wear badges about awareness that mental health is in a better place. It isn't, bar the rich and the healthy, no one thinks the services or support are good enough. Another big thing is the help you get is off someone who's book learnt it, it is so hard to understand truly what's going on until you've lived it, this film portrays it near perfectly.The interactions were great, when you're only moderately bad or fine people always come across as supportive and good but as soon as things go weird especially if it's out of character they bolt. It's very common and was shown here. Yes what she did was scary but if you truly love someone the care should be unconditional, which is why she gravitates to the one person who accepts her fully, another bit of good writing.People with mental health problems aren't bad, some of the problems boil from good things to an extreme degree, over caring about everything to a minute degree that it makes life impossible to manage in such a chaotic world!It was a cleverly put together plot, linked the story well, the acting by the lead was flawless, there were a few tired horror tropes and a couple of bits at the end felt a bit questionable but other than that it was a great watch. I can't remember being as impressed with acting in a horror as I was with this and hawke in black phone.If you look beneath the surface this has a great message, to do more than awareness, to actually realise that this new age anxiety that people go on about is a condition but nothing compared to some of the more severe ailments, those people are the ones desperately needing love and support. I'm tired of seeing mental health exploited and abused by lazy vain people. We've got a society so mean that even kids now suffer at an alarming rate.Be kind to people, all anyone wants is love and happiness, some just have a far harder journey to that destination.Great film!",see review mention generic kinda norm horror particularly easy create something truly unique bet even think one another similar theme feel modern version ring important underlying message mental health huge point tension society brave film use part plot potential affect people misconception people tweet instagram wear badge awareness mental health better place bar rich healthy one think service support good enough another big thing help get someone book learnt hard understand truly going lived film portrays near perfectly interaction great moderately bad fine people always come across supportive good soon thing go weird especially character bolt common shown yes scary truly love someone care unconditional gravitates one person accepts fully another bit good writing people mental health problem bad problem boil good thing extreme degree caring everything minute degree make life impossible manage chaotic world cleverly put together plot linked story well acting lead flawless tired horror trope couple bit end felt bit questionable great watch remember impressed acting horror hawke black phone look beneath surface great message awareness actually realise new age anxiety people go condition nothing compared severe ailment people one desperately needing love support tired seeing mental health exploited abused lazy vain people got society mean even kid suffer alarming rate kind people anyone want love happiness far harder journey destination great film

"This movies story and sensibility gradually fell apart after the cat scene.The fact that the going theme afterward was mental illness - and coupled with the fact that the writers were boldly attempting to send messages via extremely unnatural acting that those struggling mentally (after trauma) should not be heard, considered, or defended in anyway by loved ones, made it even worse.The movie was also missing key information which also made it appear as if not only mental illness, but suicide, is genetic, passed down and inherited and to shut those struggling down and abandon real support and love because, whatever they need to say or get out isn't of importance.Trauma, mental illness and/or Suicide isnt some trait that those with the ""cleanest"" or ""purest"" genes can avoid. It can happen to anyone regardless of where you come from.

"I feel like the elevator pitch for this movie was: ""imagine It Follows except you can't get rid of the curse just by having sex"". Unfortunately, the script did not lean into the premise enough - while there were a few scenes where the menace promised by the setup was used to reasonable effect, the movie was let down by an over-reliance on jump scares. From a purely personal point of view, I think I watched this movie at the exact time when I had finally seen one too many protagonists drop a glass after being frightened by a random noise. At least the film was meta enough to make a joke about this at its own expense. A bit more metatextuality could have added depth to an otherwise generic ""why won't anyone believe I'm not crazy"" narrative. In the end, the makers of this film could not resist the temptation to jump from ""invisible menace"" to ""dodgy CGI creature feature"". A note to movie makers: this is almost never the right call.",feel like elevator pitch movie imagine follows except get rid curse sex unfortunately script lean premise enough scene menace promised setup used reasonable effect movie let reliance jump scare purely personal point view think watched movie exact time finally seen one many protagonist drop glass frightened random noise least film meta enough make joke expense bit metatextuality could added depth otherwise generic anyone believe crazy narrative end maker film could resist temptation jump invisible menace dodgy cgi creature feature note movie maker almost never right call

"This film could have been great. Fantastic even. But it ruined it for a cheap ""scare.""
I never write reviews, but I couldn't not for this one.This movie was great, deeper than a simple ghost story, (though it did rely pretty heavily on the good ol' jump scare) and dove into a metaphorical representation of trauma and its rippling effects. A good mind game that left you wondering what the protagonist would do. Decent jump scares, but more importantly an ever present sense of tension and dread that really kept me hooked.It dealt directly with suicide which I think is a subject that COULD be treated in horror books and films to great effect in a way that is constructive. This movie had that potential and even, in its near final moments delivered a final message that trauma, no matter how serious and long-held could be defeated and used to make you a better person. Wow what a message to get from a horror movie! If they'd stopped there, this would have been a top 10 horror film in my opinion. But no, they had to use the age old switcheroo at the end to say ""Gotcha! This ghost/demon is still out there! Stay tuned for a sequel!"" Because of that, now what is the message? ""Trauma cannot be defeated, no matter how hard you try. Suicide is the only way out."" Nice. Real nice Hollywood. You took what Horror should be, which is an exploration of the darker side of humanity and human nature so that we can better cope with life, and turned it into a cheap grab for a sequel.

"This movie had an interesting premise and the trailer looked promising. The execution is pretty lackluster. First of all, this movie doesn't break any new ground. All the camera angles, character beats, and jump scares have been done in other horror movies ad nauseum. The majority of this movie is a snore fest. Even the jump scares were predictable. I found myself calling out jump scares before they happened. My biggest annoyance is the lack of character development. The main character goes through all the basic horror tropes on how not to handle a crisis. At one point the main character alludes to her character growth after being around another character, which is funny because she is the same from the beginning of the film to the end.",movie interesting premise trailer looked promising execution pretty lackluster first movie break new ground camera angle character beat jump scare done horror movie ad nauseum majority movie snore fest even jump scare predictable found calling jump scare happened biggest annoyance lack character development main character go basic horror trope handle crisis one point main character alludes character growth around another character funny beginning film end

"The acting was extra at times and it did feel like a play at times. It does have a decent plot, good premise, the acting was not there for me. The writing had a lot to with it. The director seems a bit too ambitious and his methods does confuse. Maybe it was meant to throw you off, it only left me confused. I also didn't understand why she couldn't just present the recording of her patient and explain to them that the same thing is happening to you. I would've googled, I would've gone to the ward or to the cops. It did remind me of the movie called The Ring. Very similar plot.

"Smile is without a doubt one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. Despite what I'd heard, I'm a massive horror fan and knew I had to watch it (thought it surely couldn't be worse than the new Hellraiser), and can honestly say it was a huge waste of time!For a start, the trailer basically gives away every jump-scare in the entire film; the sections in between said jump-scares are filled with dire attempts to try and piece together some form of plot, whilst aiming to recreate 'It Follows' and 'The Ring' in the worst possible (and least original) manner.The leading lady literally repeats the entire premise of her suffering about five or six times to different cast members, to the point that it genuinely feels like a sequence of 'jump-scare, recite entire plot to new character who has minimal screen time, jump-scare'.The scares themselves really are standard, blockbuster horror tropes (Conjuring, Insidious etc) with very little originality, and film lacks any form of atmosphere or real passion from the screenplay. Compared to the other big horror releases lately, Smile absolutely falls flat on its face. Just watch Barbarian instead!",smile without doubt one worst horror film ever seen despite heard massive horror fan knew watch thought surely worse new hellraiser honestly say huge waste time start trailer basically give away every jump scare entire film section said jump scare filled dire attempt try piece together form plot whilst aiming recreate follows ring worst possible least original manner leading lady literally repeat entire premise suffering five six time different cast member point genuinely feel like sequence jump scare recite entire plot new character minimal screen time jump scare scare really standard blockbuster horror trope conjuring insidious etc little originality film lack form atmosphere real passion screenplay compared big horror release lately smile absolutely fall flat face watch barbarian instead
"I had been waiting to see Smile for awhile, so I was quite excited to sit down to watch it at last. I went into watching it being hopeful despite the mixed reviews I had read.I found myself entranced by Smile. At first I thought it quite similar to It follows minus the plot holes.The story revolves around Rose, who after watching a insane patient commit suicide, comes struck down with the same illness or we should really say curse. Plagued and tormented by beings with creepy smiles, until the person tormented becomes possessed (so to speak) and ends their own life to pass the curse onto the next person who witnesses them kill themselves.I know I have already released spoilers in this, but I won't talk about the ending. Only to say, unfortunately I was very disappointed by it. I get you want to leave this open for a franchise, however I think it could have been achievable by other means.So yes, the ending definitely fell flat for me, which was kind of jarring after experiencing such a good film leading up to it.It almost felt like the writer wasn't sure how to actually end the film and kind of decided at the last minute. Regardless it was one of the better horror films released in the last 2 years I would say.I would definitely watch it again and add it to me horror DVD collection.",waiting see smile awhile quite excited sit watch last went watching hopeful despite mixed review read found entranced smile first thought quite similar follows minus plot hole story revolves around rose watching insane patient commit suicide come struck illness really say curse plagued tormented being creepy smile person tormented becomes possessed speak end life pas curse onto next person witness kill know already released spoiler talk ending say unfortunately disappointed get want leave open franchise however think could achievable mean yes ending definitely fell flat kind jarring experiencing good film leading almost felt like writer sure actually end film kind decided last minute regardless one better horror film released last year would say would definitely watch add horror dvd collection
"""Sorria"" is yet another film that comes in the style of ""postmodern horror"", using various allegories to represent evil, in this case mental illness, the feature is a collection of successes. The film tells the story of a psychologist who finds herself being haunted by a curse after one of her patients commits suicide in front of her. ""Smile"" is a little reminiscent of two other films: ""The Ring"" and ""Current"", although I like these two more than ""Smile"", we cannot ignore one of its greatest merits, the ability to transport the viewer to the anguish of if you see the world through schizophrenia, or any other mental illness of that kind, it becomes clear that the supernatural is in the psyche of its characters and that makes everything much scarier, even the way the director uses the ""curse"" through trauma works as a perfect metaphor. The film has good scares, many of them predictable but functional, the good thing here is that we don't have those little scares to please the teenager, it's all part of a larger plan that unfolds with the course of the end of the work that, after finished, is very reminiscent of ""Babadook "" another movie that I even think is superior to ""Smile"". The performances are good, the direction too, but it lacks a little salt, some narrative effects, such as the framing and use of cameras are very repetitive, in addition to the gore not causing any discomfort. But ""Smile"" is an interesting film, with a well-told story and which, viewed from the right perspective, behaves like a good horror film. 7/10.",sorria yet another film come style postmodern horror using various allegory represent evil case mental illness feature collection success film tell story psychologist find haunted curse one patient commits suicide front smile little reminiscent two film ring current although like two smile cannot ignore one greatest merit ability transport viewer anguish see world schizophrenia mental illness kind becomes clear supernatural psyche character make everything much scarier even way director us curse trauma work perfect metaphor film good scare many predictable functional good thing little scare please teenager part larger plan unfolds course end work finished reminiscent babadook another movie even think superior smile performance good direction lack little salt narrative effect framing use camera repetitive addition gore causing discomfort smile interesting film well told story viewed right perspective behaves like good horror film

"This was frustrating to watch. It was slow-moving, many of the characters (including main character) were unlikeable, and it's easy to predict how the movie ends.

"This was the first movie I watched from Parker Finn and it's promising for the future. I like his style and will definitely watch more movies from him hoping they will be of the same quality.

The horror is mild but there's definitely a freaky atmospheric suspense that keeps you glued to the screen. Sosie Bacon is for sure the daughter of Kevin, very similar characteristics.

I honestly don't get the good reviews. It definitely had potential then fell flat. I liked it till the end. It kind of was a cross between It Follows and the ring? I really liked IT Follows because it was an original. This movie copied it and then didn't know how to end it so it gave you the most generic ending possibly. It actually took me a minute to even realize it was the ending. Writers definitely dropped the ball on this one which is a shame because casting was really done well. It just needed something more. It wasn't ready to be filmed and needed writers to put more thought into it.

"Well Smile is a bit formulate, but still tells of a good story. Like many of the horror genre Smile has the formula of a supernatural event which no one believes is haunting the protagonist. The other formulated part of Woke Hollywood Smile starts out sort of woke, but is actual anti woke. The character develop into real life people, with flaws and believable character arches. Smile works for a character driven movies. The protagonist has inner demons which has a thin story line of post trauma, without a long preachy message about PTSD! What happens with the protagonist that experiences trauma gets hit by a trauma demon after a suicided at the psych ward. There is a chain patterns, which intertwines with each character. The protagonist past intertwines with the current main story for an intriguing of two stories . What does not work is I seen all the plot device scares before time. I missed out on the fear factor.

"The horror ""Smile"" suddenly burst into my information space. Several websites and bloggers became sources of information about the film at once. The project, which, according to my information, was supposed to take place immediately on video, was still decided to be released in cinemas. And it worked perfectly, even if the marketing campaign was not extensive. Nevertheless, a picture with a budget not particularly large even for a horror movie of $ 17 million collected a box office of 200 + million. This is an undoubted success. And the picture has rightfully achieved such heights.The plot, on the one hand, seems to be hackneyed and familiar from many related projects, on the other, for me it was very original and peculiar. A certain entity pursues the main character and the smiles of people who usually have to establish communication between people and are a manifestation of sympathy, from now on become something sinister and dangerous.Already the first few scenes fascinate and make you feel the picture. And although the authors use the well-known horror-screamer mechanics, when sharp camera hits and loud ear-beating sounds frighten the viewer, these moves look very timely and create an appropriate mood. Here is a high-quality horror film with a good plot and excellent acting. Pumping music, dark plans, muted colors - all this turns out to be in place and really works.The cast is good. Here every hero looks real. The main character performed by Sozi Bacon evoked sympathy and sympathy, finding herself literally one-on-one with evil spirits. Her relatives and friends left the girl alone. They can also be understood. It is worth admitting that all her actions demonstrated that she was dangerous. Even for the closest ones. What a birthday scene of one of the heroes is worth. Its climax made me look at what was happening with wide-open eyes. To imagine such a development of events in real life is unthinkable consequences for the hero of the occasion and his guests.Caitlin Stacy is also good. Her heroine begins this story. A pretty actress because of her smile in this film will now, I think, be perceived with some apprehension. Excellent performance of an important role in the film.The film intrigues with its detective component. The main character Rose is trying to figure out what exactly is haunting her. Given the horrors that are happening to her and the almost complete lack of support for anyone, the girl has a core and is clearly not from the timid ten. What a wicked irony. She is a psychiatrist, and she finds herself in the role of a lunatic. I think that it was her training and profession that allowed her to cope with the surging horrors, if I may say so, of course. With all her problems, she didn't break down, but was able to get to the truth.With all the positive aspects, the picture personally had a significant minus for me. It is difficult to explain, but the third act of the film turned out to be sharply uninteresting and predictable. As soon as the detective component disappeared, I literally lost interest in the film, understanding how and what would happen next. The finale was not particularly impressive, it seemed blurry and without any surprises.In general, ""Smile"" is a good movie. It is somewhat delayed, does not claim to be the best project in its genre, but definitely deserves the attention of the audience.7 out of 10.",horror smile suddenly burst information space several website blogger became source information film project according information supposed take place immediately video still decided released cinema worked perfectly even marketing campaign extensive nevertheless picture budget particularly large even horror movie million collected box office million undoubted success picture rightfully achieved height plot one hand seems hackneyed familiar many related project original peculiar certain entity pursues main character smile people usually establish communication people manifestation sympathy become something sinister dangerous already first scene fascinate make feel picture although author use well known horror screamer mechanic sharp camera hit loud ear beating sound frighten viewer move look timely create appropriate mood high quality horror film good plot excellent acting pumping music dark plan muted color turn place really work cast good every hero look real main character performed sozi bacon evoked sympathy sympathy finding literally one one evil spirit relative friend left girl alone also understood worth admitting action demonstrated dangerous even closest one birthday scene one hero worth climax made look happening wide open eye imagine development event real life unthinkable consequence hero occasion guest caitlin stacy also good heroine begin story pretty actress smile film think perceived apprehension excellent performance important role film film intrigue detective component main character rose trying figure exactly haunting given horror happening almost complete lack support anyone girl core clearly timid ten wicked irony psychiatrist find role lunatic think training profession allowed cope surging horror may say course problem break able get truth positive aspect picture personally significant minus difficult explain third act film turned sharply uninteresting predictable soon detective component disappeared literally lost interest film understanding would happen next finale particularly impressive seemed blurry without surprise general smile good movie somewhat delayed claim best project genre definitely deserves attention audience
"Smile is an extremely frustrating movie that I truly wanted to enjoy, but just couldn't ignore the blaring (literally) issues and poor choices.One of the strangest part of this movie is how it completely ignores how the real world works and pretends as if only Aethists exist. It's clear almost immediately that the antagonist is a possession with many of the same symptoms, yet it's not mentioned once and they never go to a church or seek out a priest. Everyone who brings up anything that isn't psychological cause is just labeled as crazy.When it came to costuming, effects, and gore, the creators went well above and beyond what I was expecting and, with one exception, one of the best parts of the movie. The mind horror aspect is very well done and pretty clear what's happening early on and an clearly choreographed ending for those in the audience paying attention.The biggest gripe that I have with the movie is how insanely annoying out protagonist, Rose, really is. She's a neurotic compulsive liar who lacks of critical thinking and the most unbelievable part of the movie being that she's somehow a doctor. It'd be totally understandable thst she's fraying at the edges by the end of the movie, but she's like this before the plot even really begins. This level of incompetence prevents any kind of sympathy as it makes it easier when they inevitably die, but the plot puzzle of the movie ensures she's gonna get someone which shifts her to selfish at best and murderous at worst. At one point it looks like she figured out the obvious solution to the puzzle aspect of this genre and had a path forward only for her to throw it away for no reason.The sound of this movie is weirdly polarized. Every sound that builds atmosphere and tension while making your skin crawl was outstanding, but the balancing and editing were horrible. Conversant overuse of overly loud sounds to emulate jump scares because the actual jump scares simply can't hold up on their own break any kind of immersion and grates. Several points in the film, the sound goes from silent to blaring so loud it's causing ear pain.Overall, this one was not enjoyable. I might watch it again to make fun of the more over-the-top parts, but never as a scary movie rewatch.",smile extremely frustrating movie truly wanted enjoy ignore blaring literally issue poor choice one strangest part movie completely ignores real world work pretend aethists exist clear almost immediately antagonist possession many symptom yet mentioned never go church seek priest everyone brings anything psychological cause labeled crazy came costuming effect gore creator went well beyond expecting one exception one best part movie mind horror aspect well done pretty clear happening early clearly choreographed ending audience paying attention biggest gripe movie insanely annoying protagonist rose really neurotic compulsive liar lack critical thinking unbelievable part movie somehow doctor totally understandable thst fraying edge end movie like plot even really begin level incompetence prevents kind sympathy make easier inevitably die plot puzzle movie ensures gonna get someone shift selfish best murderous worst one point look like figured obvious solution puzzle aspect genre path forward throw away reason sound movie weirdly polarized every sound build atmosphere tension making skin crawl outstanding balancing editing horrible conversant overuse overly loud sound emulate jump scare actual jump scare simply hold break kind immersion grate several point film sound go silent blaring loud causing ear pain overall one enjoyable might watch make fun top part never scary movie rewatch
"Creepy smiles can be cool. That is, on Google Image Search or in a social media post. But they do not a movie make. The trailer made such a big damn deal out of the scary grins that it's not only disappointing to discover that not only do they play an insignificant role in the movie, but that they're just one of a dozen or so random plot elements that first-time writer-director Parker Finn throws into the mix. He seems to believe that a scary image is enough to drive a plot, and it just isn't. Like so many recent horror movies, there's a seed of a really good film here: trauma is carried with you and must be unleashed in order for you to stay sane. But also like so many recent horror movies, it buries that seed under a compost heap of jump scares, plot holes, ludicrous character motivations, sloppy attempts at suspense, bad CGI, and horrible writing. Worst of all, the movie refuses to follow its own internal logic, always an indicator that a writer's in over his head. It runs far too long, wallowing in subplot threads that go nowhere, and the last 15 minutes feel like a completely different movie. And I challenge anyone to explain why the 1958 bubblegum hit ""Lollipop"" plays under the end credits. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the only true chills in this movie. The rest is dull, pointless filler.",creepy smile cool google image search social medium post movie make trailer made big damn deal scary grin disappointing discover play insignificant role movie one dozen random plot element first time writer director parker finn throw mix seems believe scary image enough drive plot like many recent horror movie seed really good film trauma carried must unleashed order stay sane also like many recent horror movie buries seed compost heap jump scare plot hole ludicrous character motivation sloppy attempt suspense bad cgi horrible writing worst movie refuse follow internal logic always indicator writer head run far long wallowing subplot thread go nowhere last minute feel like completely different movie challenge anyone explain bubblegum hit lollipop play end credit seen trailer seen true chill movie rest dull pointless filler

I thought I could handle it because I have never dealt with this kind of thing before, but maybe reconsider your headspace and wellness before viewing. A good film for casual movie goers.

"The movie is fairly decent with how it's constructed. Using the demon as a platform for mental illness and trauma although not the most orginal is still an effective use. It creates this feeling of isolation that the main protagonist towards the end of the movie basically must face this thing alone because she's technically the only one that's living it, others have lived it, some may even be going through it but no one can understand it like yourself because you're living through it. The ending however erases all that preamble dramatically and instead stands to be a nothing movie by the end of it. No one wins, the cycle continues. It feels like a waste of time by the end because there's nothing to gain from it, almost like it's saying there's no point to your struggle the demon will win anyway which for me is heavily insulting. It invalidates the struggle of the characters; giving a feeling of what's the point; you're going to fail anyway. A movie that I believe does what this one tried to do better is babadook. I'd recommend giving that one a look into.",movie fairly decent constructed using demon platform mental illness trauma although orginal still effective use creates feeling isolation main protagonist towards end movie basically must face thing alone technically one living others lived may even going one understand like living ending however era preamble dramatically instead stand nothing movie end one win cycle continues feel like waste time end nothing gain almost like saying point struggle demon win anyway heavily insulting invalidates struggle character giving feeling point going fail anyway movie believe one tried better babadook recommend giving one look
"This movie gives all the jump scares a casual horror fan needs to score cuddles from a new girlfriend, and lead to some popcorn spills. Still, under the surface, there is a deeper and better film.I feel the ""you aren't possessed! You are just crazy"" backdrop exists in many horror films. Some may even say it's overused. But THIS film does a masterful job of displaying what it: A) must feel like to be psychologically unstable, and B) what others see (or don't see) when someone is struggling mentally.I think this film will take criticism from ""horror buffs"" for the abundance of jumps scares, moments of ""spelling out"" feelings, and not trusting the audience will be sophisticated enough to grasp some of the feelings of the characters. Aside from that, this is a hit. A great film and another great addition to the genre.The future of horror is in great hands!!!!",movie give jump scare casual horror fan need score cuddle new girlfriend lead popcorn spill still surface deeper better film feel possessed crazy backdrop exists many horror film may even say overused film masterful job displaying must feel like psychologically unstable b others see see someone struggling mentally think film take criticism horror buff abundance jump scare moment spelling feeling trusting audience sophisticated enough grasp feeling character aside hit great film another great addition genre future horror great hand
"I can say that it was a better movie compared to the horror movies of the past few years.The script and music, which are two important pillars of horror movies, were almost good but not great. It tries very hard to instill the feeling of fear into the viewer from the beginning of the movie, and the person looks at the sequences with stress and everyone is afraid of what will happen next, which is a positive point, but I can't say that they did it 100% successfully, at least for me.(Of course, I must say that I am a very strict person in the horror genre and maybe it will be a great movie for other friends who do not agree with me).It would have been better if the narration and depth of the story had been worked more methodically, and of course it could have had a much better ending than this
In my opinion, it could have been one of the scariest films in the history of cinema, which did not achieve this success, but at least it was better than the weak films of the past few years.It is recommended for lovers of the horror genre...Average movie

"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulRose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a successful psychologist, who is left traumatised after a patient, Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stacey) kills herself in front of her, after flashing a disturbing, unhinged smile at her. After some time passes, Rose begins seeing others around her shooting the same disturbed grin in her direction, pushing her to the brink of insanity. She must get to the bottom of what's behind the madness, before it consumes her completely.There are Worse Fates Than Death, is an oft-quoted saying, that can be applied to a number of scenarios in life, and has a unique application in the horror genre. The common fear preyed upon is the impending fear of death, at the hands of some gruesome monster, that the afflicted prey must escape from as fast as possible. But sometimes, it's not so much a physical fear, as something that can mess with your mind. Not many people would fear any physical harm from the painting The Scream, but the sheer sight of it for many is enough to contort their sense of normalcy and calm as to bring on a feeling of madness. In place of a scream, the feature length debut of writer-director Parker Finn has a creepy smile at its centre, working on a similar premise with negligible results.It's an intriguing premise in and of itself, with a lot of meaty potential to work with as a horror story, and it does manage some effective scare scenes around its set-up. Sadly, though, most of the best ones have already been shown in the trailer, and like many modern horror films, it's soon relying on excessive blood and gore to get by, more than earning its 18 certificate. While the story has promise, it leaves a lot of loose ends untied, and doesn't really give much of a satisfactory explanation behind the mystery of what's driving the deadly smile to target the lead character, and what personal connection it's got to her.It rounds itself off with that familiar horror trope, leaving the ending open for a sequel, clearly hoping to spawn a horror franchise. Its box office success offers a surefire likelihood of that, so hopefully the next outing manages to trim round the edges a little better, and produce a slightly more polished result. ***",star rating brilliant good okay poor awfulrose cotter sosie bacon successful psychologist left traumatised patient laura weaver caitlin stacey kill front flashing disturbing unhinged smile time pass rose begin seeing others around shooting disturbed grin direction pushing brink insanity must get bottom behind madness consumes completely worse fate death oft quoted saying applied number scenario life unique application horror genre common fear preyed upon impending fear death hand gruesome monster afflicted prey must escape fast possible sometimes much physical fear something mess mind many people would fear physical harm painting scream sheer sight many enough contort sense normalcy calm bring feeling madness place scream feature length debut writer director parker finn creepy smile centre working similar premise negligible result intriguing premise lot meaty potential work horror story manage effective scare scene around set sadly though best one already shown trailer like many modern horror film soon relying excessive blood gore get earning certificate story promise leaf lot loose end untied really give much satisfactory explanation behind mystery driving deadly smile target lead character personal connection got round familiar horror trope leaving ending open sequel clearly hoping spawn horror franchise box office success offer surefire likelihood hopefully next outing manages trim round edge little better produce slightly polished result
"Heard good things about this movie and was actually somewhat looking forward to seeing it, but was honestly let down a little bit.It started pretty strong and had some a couple good moments in the first act (first instance of the smiling in the kitchen, bedroom in the dark) and it seemed like it would fairly scary, but as it went along it started to lose me a bit and left me wanting more, especially with the voice/shadow standing in the dark bathroom. As others have said, it feels a lot like a Mashup of ""It Follows"" and ""The Ring"" and I feel like it would've landed better for me if it had been released in the early 2000s.This film also really likes its upside down shots, which isn't inherently bad, but definitely overused bit imo (this also goes for the constant use of crescendo and loud sounds that transition to immediate silence).Overall, it definitely isn't a bad film, but it also doesn't do a spectacular job at anything so I wouldn't give it anything above a 5/10.",heard good thing movie actually somewhat looking forward seeing honestly let little bit started pretty strong couple good moment first act first instance smiling kitchen bedroom dark seemed like would fairly scary went along started lose bit left wanting especially voice shadow standing dark bathroom others said feel lot like mashup follows ring feel like would landed better released early film also really like upside shot inherently bad definitely overused bit imo also go constant use crescendo loud sound transition immediate silence overall definitely bad film also spectacular job anything give anything
"Pros:
1. The camera-work is amazing. The camera floats around giving off an eerily off-putting feel whilst the centred shots force the audience to constantly be aware of the surroundings.2. Sosie Bacon (Rose Cotter) delivers a wonderful performance. Her characters' descent into madness is both captivating and terrifying.3. For the most part, the tension is built-up well via well-timed jump-scares and the slow panning of the camera.4. The score is incredibly chilling and utilised to great effect in highlighting Rose Cotter's descent into madness.5. The movie does a great job at showcasing the unrelenting potency of trauma. How it never leaves in addition to how trauma begets trauma.6. The reveal of the demon is masterful. Both of its' designs are nightmare fuel.Cons:
1. The movie, especially towards the end, devolves into a jump-scare-fest.2. Most of the male characters are often treated with contempt and disregard which makes it really difficult to like the female characters - including Rose Cotter.3. Somehow Joel (Kyle Gallner) knew where to find Rose Cotter at her old house even though she'd never told him where to find her. It's clearly a lazy plot device to keep the trauma demon going.4. Because the demon essentially serves as a personification for trauma, it does make the story feel rather wafer-thin as it clearly comes second to the topic of trauma.",pro camera work amazing camera float around giving eerily putting feel whilst centred shot force audience constantly aware surroundings sosie bacon rose cotter delivers wonderful performance character descent madness captivating terrifying part tension built well via well timed jump scare slow panning camera score incredibly chilling utilised great effect highlighting rose cotter descent madness movie great job showcasing unrelenting potency trauma never leaf addition trauma begets trauma reveal demon masterful design nightmare fuel con movie especially towards end devolves jump scare fest male character often treated contempt disregard make really difficult like female character including rose cotter somehow joel kyle gallner knew find rose cotter old house even though never told find clearly lazy plot device keep trauma demon going demon essentially serf personification trauma make story feel rather wafer thin clearly come second topic trauma
"I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. The scares in the trailer were definitely not all of them and honestly they conserved the best for the actual movie. There are jump scares , as always, but were executed perfectly and weren't expected. There were definitely some MAJORLY suspenseful moments and I just absolutely didn't expect the ending, consider how so many modern horror movies end. The highlight is by FAR the acting. Sosie Bacon KILLED this role every single second she was on screen. You see the complete destruction of this poor woman's psyche and it's so cool to see a psychiatrist be on the other side of the table. There were little moments of humor that got the theater laughing then completely followed by the sounds of ""OH SH-"" when the scares came.

"Not a bad film by any means but (more or less) experienced viewers will notice plot holes and certain cliches. This is a spoiler-free review so I will not get specific.Cinematography: Clearly above averageVisual effects: Generally goodSound effects/design/soundtrack: Mostly good, occasionally over the topPlot: Interesting, has some holes, gets undermined by characters' choicesDialogues: Mostly believable, occasionally dumpProtagonist: Good enough for the film's purpose but her character development feels a little rushed or under-examined. Makes many dump choices for the plot's sake.Side characters: Unmemorable, sometimes over-emphasize their feelings or thoughts to the point dialogues feel unrealistic. Since the film focuses more on the protagonist, luckily, they never get too annoying.Horror: Expect some uninspired jumpscares but an overall creepy atmosphere I have to commend.All in all, Smile is a classic example of a good movie idea that disappointes with its execution. To be fair, none of its drawbacks is too bad so you can totally have a good time watching it and I would definitely recommend it to most horror fans. Would I rewatch it?

"Looks like a lot of people in the comments hate horror movies but keep going out to see them. Also those are the same people complaining that horror movies are unoriginal...Which misses the main part about horror movies, they aren't supposed to be a nuance character exploration like drama films... they are a fun ride where you get scared and have fun then go on with your life.Horror movies are not serious people, they are just a fun date night or night in movie with your SO, nothing more and nothing less.Having said all that, this movie is awesome, its fun from start to finish and never boring, sure its not a new premise but its masterfully directed, shot, acted, edited, everything.Great job everyone who worked on this.",look like lot people comment hate horror movie keep going see also people complaining horror movie unoriginal miss main part horror movie supposed nuance character exploration like drama film fun ride get scared fun go life horror movie serious people fun date night night movie nothing nothing le said movie awesome fun start finish never boring sure new premise masterfully directed shot acted edited everything great job everyone worked
"Honestly, I would rate it a 6.5/10 but because of how TERRIBLE other recent releases were (Terrifier 2, The Barbarian, Halloween Ends...or the hand sanitized Scream 2022 reboot - how much are reviewers being paid for promoting these!????) this stands out against the bunch.There's no overly convoluted plot lines, there's no cheap gore, and the plot is very simple yet effective.Yes it's the same idea as The Ring or It Follows, which is not a bad thing. It's much gorier than those two and deals with passing down trauma and mental illness in a less preachy way than most ""elevated"" horror.The jump scares are decent. The acting is good from Sosie and Kyle.This is very much in the vein as Sinister (2022).Is it scary? No.Is it well-made, entertaining and effective? Yes.Is it predictable? Yes.",honestly would rate terrible recent release terrifier barbarian halloween end hand sanitized scream reboot much reviewer paid promoting stand bunch overly convoluted plot line cheap gore plot simple yet effective yes idea ring follows bad thing much gorier two deal passing trauma mental illness le preachy way elevated horror jump scare decent acting good sosie kyle much vein sinister scary well made entertaining effective yes predictable yes
"Smiling is also a scary thing now.Frankly, after watching the trailer of the movie, I understood that it would be a bad movie. It was obvious. I didn't like the movie overall. We watched movies like this many times. First of all, let me write what I liked about the movie. Sosie Bacon. I think she put on a very good acting performance. I didn't like the other actors' performances very much. There were ok. Maybe Kyle Gallner was ok . . . Other, the advertising and marketing of the movie was very good. It was viral. Lastly, I liked the finale of the movie. Frankly, I would have been very angry if the optimist had ended. Luckily, it ended the way I wanted. Things I don't like: Effects and cgi's. Jump scares and sound scares. The scene of hearing a sound while listening to audio on the computer was good, though. And sister scene, you know :) Smile scenes were bad most of the time. Cringe sometimes. Also, the cat scene made me very sad. Overall, it's a fun movie to watch. But it's not a good movie. Plus, Rose Cotter is a terrible therapist :)",smiling also scary thing frankly watching trailer movie understood would bad movie obvious like movie overall watched movie like many time first let write liked movie sosie bacon think put good acting performance like actor performance much ok maybe kyle gallner ok advertising marketing movie good viral lastly liked finale movie frankly would angry optimist ended luckily ended way wanted thing like effect cgi jump scare sound scare scene hearing sound listening audio computer good though sister scene know smile scene bad time cringe sometimes also cat scene made sad overall fun movie watch good movie plus rose cotter terrible therapist
"First the good: well filmed and creepy soundtrack. Decent acting, given the source material.The plot is unoriginal, probably because the director only did short films before this. Needlessly long runtime, just to pack in a few more jump scares. Probably would have enjoyed it more had it been 20 mins shorter, so definitely a reason that less is more.Unlikeable characters and the most senseless behaviour by the protagonist, especially in the age of Google and social media. Even the antagonist is kinda lame if you think about it, with character motivations sorely lacking.Put it this way, 2/3 through the show, I was rooting for the villain to win just because I dislike the main character for her stupidity.",first good well filmed creepy soundtrack decent acting given source material plot unoriginal probably director short film needlessly long runtime pack jump scare probably would enjoyed min shorter definitely reason le unlikeable character senseless behaviour protagonist especially age google social medium even antagonist kinda lame think character motivation sorely lacking put way show rooting villain win dislike main character stupidity
"No fluff, let's get real. This is a true horror film- one that unmasks the root of what *really scares us (in real- life). And that's not jump scares or gory scenes for shock-value. It digs deeper- into the internal & invisible, unresolved trauma that manifests itself into tangible fears & psychological damage. What if some of those we deem ""crazy"" are the ones who are actually willing to sacrifice their label of ""normal"" in order to try to resolve their trauma? Masking our fears has the tendency to create this veil of ""normal"", but being our true, broken selves make us look like a ""nutcase"". Pills and building a good reputation in society can be used as masks to hide our ""crazy""- but can it resolve & heal trauma?This film transcends your generic horror film when it shifts its focus from the external solution to trauma (the masking) into the internal (mental & spiritual) battle to fight your fears. Its approach to fear is similar to the IT movies.. I love the screenplay towards the end when the lead finally faces her fears.Also- the gorgeous, uncanny cinematography was so effective.That said, it's not a 10 because of minor flaws based on personal taste (ex: the overuse of cheap jump scares- except for ones where I actually screamed haha). And the ending was a little abrupt and... questionable.Smile is the FIRST (feature) film of Parker Finn and he shot-listed the entire movie himself. I mean, I can tell. Finn's passion for this film showed by his use of cinematography and screenplay to make the movie meaningful and impactful to the audience. Inspiring work!",fluff let get real true horror film one unmasks root really scare u real life jump scare gory scene shock value dig deeper internal invisible unresolved trauma manifest tangible fear psychological damage deem crazy one actually willing sacrifice label normal order try resolve trauma masking fear tendency create veil normal true broken self make u look like nutcase pill building good reputation society used mask hide crazy resolve heal trauma film transcends generic horror film shift focus external solution trauma masking internal mental spiritual battle fight fear approach fear similar movie love screenplay towards end lead finally face fear also gorgeous uncanny cinematography effective said minor flaw based personal taste ex overuse cheap jump scare except one actually screamed haha ending little abrupt questionable smile first feature film parker finn shot listed entire movie mean tell finn passion film showed use cinematography screenplay make movie meaningful impactful audience inspiring work

"This movie had potential, but they picked the wrong people to be the lead actors and actresses. The husband is awful. He just has no presence. There's no chemistry between him and the main woman which is Sosie Bacon I guess her name is she's just like weak, frail for being a psychiatrist dealing with that she's just very unrealistic. The music was good and the theme was good but the whole presentation with the actors they chose is awful. I'd like to see it redone, but with better actors and actresses too bad another one that had potential of a lost it I'm really getting tired of these horror flicks that just have terrible actors and actresses in it.

"Wow, this was a huge disappointment. After some glowing reviews and good word of mouth I must admit I was expecting a lot more from this horror movie. It starts off well enough with a gruesome scene and especially a great, eerie atmosphere. I found the first third to be great with a few too many jump scares as my only complaint. But as the movie progressed so did my dislike towards it, as the main character just became totally unlikable and any good will I had was starting to fade. One of the tropes I hate the most in these kind of movies is when no one believes the main character and she just comes off as crazy even if she has a ton of evidence to backup her claims, I think it's lazy and a very easy way to try and create conflict. It then culminates in a very underwhelming and predictable climax that I just hated. Technically I really liked this movie and Parker Finn showed a lot of promise with his direction and I'm very curious to see where he goes from here, but he needs to write better screenplays or his movies will always be a very frustrating watch. Unfortunately all the technical aspects aren't enough for me to recommend this movie.",wow huge disappointment glowing review good word mouth must admit expecting lot horror movie start well enough gruesome scene especially great eerie atmosphere found first third great many jump scare complaint movie progressed dislike towards main character became totally unlikable good starting fade one trope hate kind movie one belief main character come crazy even ton evidence backup claim think lazy easy way try create conflict culminates underwhelming predictable climax hated technically really liked movie parker finn showed lot promise direction curious see go need write better screenplay movie always frustrating watch unfortunately technical aspect enough recommend movie

"Very unprofessional psychiatrist for not trying to listen and understand her patient. She went straight to giving her patient a mental treatment. This movie is really frustrating to watch with so much delusional characters not willing to listen. The story seems like a rip-off from the movie ""The Ring"", where the person who watched a cursed tape will have 7 days to live. To cure the curse, you will need to make a copy of the tape and make someone else watch it. This movie is based on the same concept. The cursed person will curse you by making you seeing them smile and the only way to cure yourself is to kill someone.",unprofessional psychiatrist trying listen understand patient went straight giving patient mental treatment movie really frustrating watch much delusional character willing listen story seems like rip movie ring person watched cursed tape day live cure curse need make copy tape make someone else watch movie based concept cursed person curse making seeing smile way cure kill someone
"Really I don't have any real thoughts on this. It goes along with so many other post-2000 horror films.Half-baked commentary about mental health and using said mental health as the concept for a horror film. Really don't think I've seen many horror films with an interesting perspective on this topic. Most of them just use neurodivergent people as elements of horror.This one is really creepy and disturbing. Even with the gimmick horror tropes and re-used storylines this one is still competent. Even if it is unoriginal.I think I might follow this director's career.

"A psychiatrist acting like a total lunatic without an ounce of reflection or distance about her state of mind... Talking to people like someone who has absolutely no idea on how the human mind work. The best example is the moment where she shout to her husband that she is not crazy. That got me out of the film right away...
Does she really have to say crazy things all the time ? Could she for example be a little bit smart about it and talke let's say, about collective hallucination, inconscious hypnosis or any BS like that ?? No instead we have ""I'm possessed by this thing BUT IT'S NOT ME, please believe me... BELIEVE ME RIGHT KNOW !!!!""
The second huge mistake is the cop being grossed out by what he sees on the computer... THIS IS IS JOB, he see that 8 hours a day...
Seing those ""professionnals"" the doc and the cop reacting is like watching a butcher being grossed out by roadkill... IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE !!The dream in front of the hospital in her car had me facepalm.It took her 1h30 to realize what any working brain had in mind at 30mn of the movie, that you have to be alone in a FRIENDLY place without anything to hurt you with. And just keep ignoring anything that is not usual. And that's all you'll be fine. But no until the end she keep overacting in front of anything she sees.The entire scene in her childhood house is ridiculous. The monster has so much ""IT 2"" vibes : ""too make it scarier just make it bigger !""... No, just no.Nothing work and that's where i laugh out loud several times, the only good moment is at 1h48 of the movie, don't blink because you'll miss it.The end is beyond stupid, not achieving a single thing, leaving the story at the exact same point where it begin, with NONE of the character having evolve in any way other than the very very very boring rules of this curse/demon/alien/MST/BS.I was so bored that i started writting this review at the middle of the movie...

"Okay some small stuff:The Harold & Kumar guy, really?Usher?It just that there was a bit of...odd casting. Bits that weren't crucial but were a bit jarring. It's weird thinking ""White Castle"" while the atmosphere is tense psychological horror.Another gripe is setting. The film at first largely and initially takes place in a psychiatric facility, which itself seems like would always be a prime spot for these kinds of films. But immediately instead of (satisfyingly) being give a few 'smile' moments involving the facility's patients, a plot point sends the character away from this setting.Directly after this above mentioned scene-shift, the film starts to pick up, with a very memorable birthday scene. But otherwise we're now more than 45 minutes into a film with just under two hours with very little actual plot progression.This film drags on, occasionally delivering a jump scare, but seems more like a way to give a few rarely heard names some work, and to meet some weird overly diverse diversity quotas.Edit: After a second-showing I stand with this abysmal score; there honestly IS an interesting concept here except that it's at a glance a very flimsy copy of 'The Ring / Ringu'. It's almost a shameless afterthought as far as plot point goes but it's a concept (without delving too deep to avoid spoilers) directly taken from those mentioned films.Another thing at times this film almost seems like a look into various mental illness and could even be a societal look on how we as a society view those with mental illness. . . The issue here is the only time someone with an actual mental illness is shown on screen they're actually shown to be relatively unhinged and nothing else; if it's a film looking to have a second or third layer in this way, it was a weird way achieving this.",okay small stuff harold kumar guy really usher bit odd casting bit crucial bit jarring weird thinking white castle atmosphere tense psychological horror another gripe setting film first largely initially take place psychiatric facility seems like would always prime spot kind film immediately instead satisfyingly give smile moment involving facility patient plot point sends character away setting directly mentioned scene shift film start pick memorable birthday scene otherwise minute film two hour little actual plot progression film drag occasionally delivering jump scare seems like way give rarely heard name work meet weird overly diverse diversity quota edit second showing stand abysmal score honestly interesting concept except glance flimsy copy ring ringu almost shameless afterthought far plot point go concept without delving deep avoid spoiler directly taken mentioned film another thing time film almost seems like look various mental illness could even societal look society view mental illness issue time someone actual mental illness shown screen actually shown relatively unhinged nothing else film looking second third layer way weird way achieving
"While it starts out quick+with our first casualty+, it does get bogged down in the first act for quite awhile trying to get anywhere.Our protagonist is a large hospital psychiatrist or clinition who deals in emergency psychiatric patient entries into the hospital.

That bites her in the butt when she is sadfled with the CURSED patient.The whole smile thing is akin to a chain letter. You pass it along like smiley suicide, but you get to have a nice nervous breakdown for 3-7 days before hand. And by the time you check out, all of your friends and family are sure you have list your mind, no matter how sane you were just days before. Because total mental health breaks with suicide occur in days without a reason all the time, right? And totally normal intelligent college educated people start believing in curses and seeing things ""just like that""...but no one who loves them will listen. Because just about everyone in their lives is a total dick.And it seems like the best way to pass on the curse, is to be the sad sack, that cares.I'm sure the sister and her husband will now be able to sell the property where mom and now the main character both offed themselves.

"Nothing special, just some jump scare with sudden loud noise. Typical stupid people with poor decision making. The story is clichÃ© just like almost all regular horror movies. Acting is fine. There were a lot of potential and possible good twist, but they decided to just make it cheap and end with a mediocre and typical unsurprising ending where the protagonist is obviously easily defeated. Not really good, I regret watching it. I was expecting something more realistic and different, something unique. This movie is easily forgettable. Please don't make a part 2.

"The last time I saw a movie with this much tension was 2018's ""Hereditary"". From the opening scenes to the remaining seconds of the movie, I felt like I was in a constant state of tension. Lots of great use of low light sequences that makes the movie even more dark and creepy. The director did such a good job with his filming style for example using close up facial shots to convey so much emotion and uneasiness. The music was absolutely spectacular and took the horror to another level. This movie has elements in the filming style and screenplay that remind me of films like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Ring"". Please do yourself a favor and don't wait to watch at home, it needs to be watched on the big screen especially with the use of surround sound. It is so vital to several scenes.

"First of all kudos to the person who made the trailer for this movie. The trailer obviously revealed all the best parts of the movie, while keeping the dull and underdeveloped parts hidden, resulting in another situation where the trailer is better than the movie itself.Smile starts out with an interesting premise, which keeps you on edge, instead of having usual horror flick jumpscares. The story follows the main character slipping into madness due to lack of sleep and crazy events happening to her. Most of the characters react as they would in real life and not like the movie cliches.The downfall of the movie starts in the third act. The buildup was great and keeps you wondering what will happen next. However, the lack of idea how to conclude the movie and really, really bad CGI ruined the whole movie. After all the great buildup you get a standard conclusion in horror films, where good simply cannot win over evil. That kind of ending with CGI that looked like a combination of It Chapter 2 and Beetlejuice made me regret watching this movie. What a wasted potential.",first kudos person made trailer movie trailer obviously revealed best part movie keeping dull underdeveloped part hidden resulting another situation trailer better movie smile start interesting premise keep edge instead usual horror flick jumpscares story follows main character slipping madness due lack sleep crazy event happening character react would real life like movie cliche downfall movie start third act buildup great keep wondering happen next however lack idea conclude movie really really bad cgi ruined whole movie great buildup get standard conclusion horror film good simply cannot win evil kind ending cgi looked like combination chapter beetlejuice made regret watching movie wasted potential

"As a big fan of horror i was searching for a well scripted und creepy film for a very long time. I found it in this one.Starting off a bit slow, wich was the only right decision for me, to build up the tension and give the characters at least a bit of personality. Of course this could have been done a bit more detailed. But in comparison with other horror films ive watched it actually was enough for me.The story is told in a good pace and the longer the film goes, the more interesting and creepy it gets. I even found myself with goosebumps at times because of the looks on the characters faces when they ""smiled"".But with the ending, there was a last hurdle to take to make this a good horror film. They nailed it for me.Even after my great expectations after i saw the trailer, i was not disappointed after watching the film.

"I went to see this creepy movie because I love horror movies. The movie kept me on the edge and although I liked the main character because she is Kevin Bacon's daughter in real life, I felt she did a good job acting.The horror came mainly from the music. The music made the scenery spooky and it prepared you for jump scares that happens sporadically throughout the film. The villain is similar to the one in ""Truth or Dare"" where it smiles at you and kills you within a certain period of time. I didn't like that it copied the premise of ""The Ring"" where you die in 7 days, but the film is similar. If I were to compare the two movies ""Truth or Dare"" and ""The Ring"", this movie is the baby.It does have similar eerieness to ""Malignant"" and ""Midsommar"" two more movies I love, the gore is sporadic and unique. I liked the main characters acting and Kal Penn from ""Harold and Kumar go to white castle"" was in this so I had to see it. Overall a solid horror with sporadic jump scares and creepy music.

"I attended an afternoon matinee screening of this film on opening day, and as stated above, the screen went dark about twenty minutes in, leaving the entire auditorium in darkness, but the sound still very much on. As I descended down the stairs and out of the theater, i realized I was alone. I found another theater down the hall running about fifteen minutes behind. I just went into that room and resumed the film, waiting for it to catch up. There were people in this theater too.So, yes, that was all kind of weird and creepy but this movie is silly.It really is.With an audience actually in this theater, there were people laughing. Out loud.Because it's dumb at times.Because the acting is so bad.And the editing is choppy and makes situations in the film abrupt and unbelievable.I love horror movies. Even dumb ones.This is a dumb one. So, it gets a six.Does it waste your time?

"While there are a bit of jump scares, Smile really has a way of making you feel uncomfortable from the other side of the screen. Perhaps it was the crackling noise when things are about to go down, maybe it's the awful smile many in the film wear at one point or another, but eek. I've been disappointed by most horror films I've seen in easy the last decade, but this one stands out as one of the best! I can't recommend for those of us that like being scared in a way that's not too overdone, just for the screen, fun, don't walk, to see this film!

"I went to see this at the pictures, not expecting much. The past few years haven't been that great for horror, just the usual over done stuff with predictable jump scares and unsatisfying endings. I've been disappointed with a lot of horror so I didn't expect Smile to be any different.I was pleasantly suprised. There is a bit of everything is this film. There's some good gore, but not over done. The jump scares got me good a few times in this. And while the tension was kept throughout, when they turned it up a notch, it was REALLY tense. Once you've seen the first 20 minutes and you realise what's going on, you know then that scares could literally come from anywhere, and this does leave you squirming at the dark. The creepy bits really are creepy.There is a bit towards the end where, when it happens, you think it's a bit far fetched but then 5 minutes later, you realise why it's in there and all is good.I dont know, it might be because the horror over the last few years has been garbage.... Shyamalan, Peele and James Wan are the usual favourites that have disappointed me recently, but this was alot of fun. Really glad I watched it.Even though I know the ending, I will be watching it again in a year or so.",went see picture expecting much past year great horror usual done stuff predictable jump scare unsatisfying ending disappointed lot horror expect smile different pleasantly suprised bit everything film good gore done jump scare got good time tension kept throughout turned notch really tense seen first minute realise going know scare could literally come anywhere leave squirming dark creepy bit really creepy bit towards end happens think bit far fetched minute later realise good dont know might horror last year garbage shyamalan peele james wan usual favourite disappointed recently alot fun really glad watched even though know ending watching year
"Smile is not is a bad movie whatsoever; it would have just been so much better for me if they held back on the previews and if the expectations weren't dramatically raised after lots and lots of blind praise. I wish I had went into it completely blind rather than knowing as much as I did. From trailers that showed far too much, to the onslaught of unexpected praise for reasons I wish would've stayed quiet. There was so much of the movie that was given away/spoiled. So due to that, I don't even think I could give a legitimate review with criticism as I can't even objectively figure what worked and what didn't. So this is more of a warning that you should go in absolutely blind and I think you'll have a much better time.",smile bad movie whatsoever would much better held back preview expectation dramatically raised lot lot blind praise wish went completely blind rather knowing much trailer showed far much onslaught unexpected praise reason wish would stayed quiet much movie given away spoiled due even think could give legitimate review criticism even objectively figure worked warning go absolutely blind think much better time
"I've been a fan of classic horror (not slasher) for a looong time. I've seen enough to be skeptical of horror films until they actually deliver. Smile does. Good acting, pace, music/sound, well done jump scares, as well as concept and plot (... you know, as far as horror goes). I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. The only downside was the final portions of the film where the creators felt compelled to give the evil a face. It felt unnecessary given that they had successfully avoided that (with good effect) up until those final scenes. Fortunately it wasn't a deal breaker. A solid horror film that will scare and delight fans of the genre. They did leave the door open at the end for sequels, but recycling this theme may not work.",fan classic horror slasher looong time seen enough skeptical horror film actually deliver smile good acting pace music sound well done jump scare well concept plot know far horror go edge seat film downside final portion film creator felt compelled give evil face felt unnecessary given successfully avoided good effect final scene fortunately deal breaker solid horror film scare delight fan genre leave door open end sequel recycling theme may work

"Where to begin. While I enjoyed the acting throughout the movie, I just thought it would be better than what it was. The main character witnesses the suicide of a woman who is clearly disturbed, ends up killing herself while smiling at the therapist/main character. What follows is some sort of entity that haunts her though the movie. What bugs me is while she did research the people who encountered this same supernatural phenomenon, it's never really explained. Most horror movies discover where it came from and some even suggest how to combat it. This just did not. Not a happy ending, by the way...but it IS a horror movie. You should expect that.

"After witnessing a traumatic incident involving a patient, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing frightening occurrences that she can't explain.As an overwhelming terror begins to take over her life, Rose must confront her troubling past in order to survive and escape her horrifying new reality.....It's so refreshing to see a horror film that is not only unfiltered, but satisfying at the same time. Over here in England, the film has an 18 certificate, and these are becoming more and more uncommon, because we all know that a studio likes to gain a lot of revenue, so we get a lot of watered down pap that tries to pass as horror.The main draw here is the gimmick of the curse, which isn't too dissimilar to 'It Follows', but in my humble opinion, this film just pips it to the post.The film has it's fair share of jump scares (which if you are a horror veteran, you will see a mile off), but what makes it so enjoyable and haunting is Bacons performance. You really believe that she is psychologically inept, and her downward spiral is utterly compelling. So much so, that at times, you really wish you could actually talk to the other characters, asking them just to listen to her..Another thing that makes the film work is the score. At ne point in the film, involving a birthday party, the score suddenly takes a unsettling turn, and really throws you into the film, and it's pretty tense.So all in all, it's refreshing to see a horror film pull no punches, and letting the camera stay with the tense situations, rather than cut away and leave it to the viewers imagination. But, yes, the jump scares are there, and there is one scene that blatantly rips of the remake of 'The Ring', but of you are a horror fan, this will satisfy your hunger.....",witnessing traumatic incident involving patient dr rose cotter start experiencing frightening occurrence explain overwhelming terror begin take life rose must confront troubling past order survive escape horrifying new reality refreshing see horror film unfiltered satisfying time england film certificate becoming uncommon know studio like gain lot revenue get lot watered pap try pas horror main draw gimmick curse dissimilar follows humble opinion film pip post film fair share jump scare horror veteran see mile make enjoyable haunting bacon performance really believe psychologically inept downward spiral utterly compelling much time really wish could actually talk character asking listen another thing make film work score ne point film involving birthday party score suddenly take unsettling turn really throw film pretty tense refreshing see horror film pull punch letting camera stay tense situation rather cut away leave viewer imagination yes jump scare one scene blatantly rip remake ring horror fan satisfy hunger
"It's not often that I get an uneasy, terrified feeling, while watching a movie, but this movie succeeded in doing that. I'm not sure if it was the smiles or the ways the actors died, and the looks on their faces that did it for me. It was probably a combination of both. I did find it quite funny that Kal Penn was a doctor in the movie, as he always plays a therapist or doctor in shows and movies recently. Sosie Bacon played such a convincing role, that I found myself legitimately feeling her pain and terror. She was incredibly believable and the supporting actors did an incredible job.

"There are some good elements to this movie. The suspense was established well, plus a good story despite some predictability, and decent performances (except the sister and her husband).The ending was just such a letdown. For all those professional critics who said this movie harkens back to old horror, I think they missed the endings of those films. In older horror films they had a creative ending whether it helped or hurt the protagonist or not. This ending is just phoned in, almost like the writers didn't want to have to think of a creative way to solve the problem.There are so many other movies that do this type of story better.

"The jump-scares in Parker Finn's first feature may have a high frequency rate, but the psychological anxiety makes it worth showing up for. Now that the Halloween season's coming around, this is definitely the movie you want to see with serious-minded friends and a bag of popcorn. Don't let the clichÃ©d title stop you from paying to watch Smile, because it delivers an edge-of-your-seat experience worth facing without spoilers in the way.Actress Sosie Bacon gives a very strong performance as the main character, a doctor who traumatically witnesses a patient commit suicide, followed by a string of frightening hallucinations as she tries to figure out the backstory of this curse she thinks she might be under the influence of. Surprisingly, Smile is absolutely terrifying. You can predict that there's gonna be a jump-scare coming up, but sometimes they strike earlier than you thought and give you a good jolt, and they're never false scares. But the tension's on even before the jump-scare as you're just sitting on the edge of your seat waiting.If you can get over or even handle the frequent jump-scares as well as the shock-value dream sequences, this is a psychological horror movie with an unoriginal base but an excellent execution. The hallucination are not always of people creepily smiling, but more often they're circumstances or situations that aren't actually happening or hallucinations of twisted and deformed human creatures.You can really feel the film's pacing slipping over the perfect runtime and extending some of the sequences, but it's very entertaining and unsettling to watch. It's worth noting that it's a horror-mystery film similar to others like It Follows and The Ring, but it feels like a gem that only occurs every so often. It'll be good to see if writer/director Parker Finn does any more solid features, but this movie definitely has him starting on a good roll.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",jump scare parker finn first feature may high frequency rate psychological anxiety make worth showing halloween season coming around definitely movie want see serious minded friend bag popcorn let clich title stop paying watch smile delivers edge seat experience worth facing without spoiler way actress sosie bacon give strong performance main character doctor traumatically witness patient commit suicide followed string frightening hallucination try figure backstory curse think might influence surprisingly smile absolutely terrifying predict gonna jump scare coming sometimes strike earlier thought give good jolt never false scare tension even jump scare sitting edge seat waiting get even handle frequent jump scare well shock value dream sequence psychological horror movie unoriginal base excellent execution hallucination always people creepily smiling often circumstance situation actually happening hallucination twisted deformed human creature really feel film pacing slipping perfect runtime extending sequence entertaining unsettling watch worth noting horror mystery film similar others like follows ring feel like gem occurs every often good see writer director parker finn solid feature movie definitely starting good roll liked review check full review review aussieboyreviews

"Ever since I saw the trailer for this on September 16th, 2022, I was super hyped to see it, we haven't had too many great horror/thriller films this year so I was hoping this would break the ice, and dare I say, it didn't.Smile is basically an amalgamation of every horror trope you could think of, we've got the childhood dead parent, the classic supernatural story, the unsupportive husband, and so many others, the movie tried to save itself by using actually scary jump scares and a relatively intriguing concept, but it just didn't work.Sosie Bacon surprisingly gave a great performance as our main character, but her co-stars were rough to say the least, I spent the entire film wanting to punch the cop's face in, and it has a truly horrific ending.I'm gonna give Smile a D+",ever since saw trailer september th super hyped see many great horror thriller film year hoping would break ice dare say smile basically amalgamation every horror trope could think got childhood dead parent classic supernatural story unsupportive husband many others movie tried save using actually scary jump scare relatively intriguing concept work sosie bacon surprisingly gave great performance main character co star rough say least spent entire film wanting punch cop face truly horrific ending gonna give smile
"It is a decent horror for young people with not much movie experience. Storyline and ending is predictable, and again filled with not needed jump scares. Generic horror thing happens, the main character does not believe this is true and tries to go on with her day. Slowly figures out that there is something wrong and starts investigating. Goes to another character who experienced the same and gives some convoluted answers. Decides on an action that may save her, but of course at the end the movie tries to make us believe it is over, but it's not.Absolutely nothing new, if you want a better one from the old times watch The Ring.",decent horror young people much movie experience storyline ending predictable filled needed jump scare generic horror thing happens main character believe true try go day slowly figure something wrong start investigating go another character experienced give convoluted answer decides action may save course end movie try make u believe absolutely nothing new want better one old time watch ring

"This movie is remarkably similar to ""IT Follows"", which I really enjoyed. However this movie uses more brutality and jump scares to establish its fear, rather than the slow, anxious burn that IT Follows provides. Essentially the premise is the same....a sinister element is passed on from one person to the next via means of trauma, in this case witnessing suicide, vs. A sexual encounter in IT Follows (presumably a not so subtle metaphor for the passing along of sexually transmitted diseases). The main character in both actively searches for a way to stop the cycle while encountering terrifying images that only they can see. Worth a watch for horror fans, and there's a pretty awesome jump scare in there that will definitely make you jump!",movie remarkably similar follows really enjoyed however movie us brutality jump scare establish fear rather slow anxious burn follows provides essentially premise sinister element passed one person next via mean trauma case witnessing suicide v sexual encounter follows presumably subtle metaphor passing along sexually transmitted disease main character actively search way stop cycle encountering terrifying image see worth watch horror fan pretty awesome jump scare definitely make jump

"I'm gonna start with the good. The actors are all fantastic. The cinematography (minus the upside down shots which make little sense) is really on par with what we're supposed to feel. The sfx is top notch. Sosie Bacon in particular is absolutely stellar.BUT...The script has glaring plot holes, sophomoric writing, and at times it's just downright laughable. Literally. I was sitting in one of the fullest audiences I've seen since the pandemic, and we were collectively laughing at some of the dialogue and kitsch.My biggest problem with the script is the sloppy storytelling. This movie doesn't answer the ""why this story at this time in this place?"" question. The protagonist has literally zero control over her fate. At no point does she even make a decision that dooms her. Everything happens to her and for no reason. While some will argue, ""yeah but that's what happens sometimes in life"" can shush. Yes, it happens in life. But who pays almost $20 a ticket to go watch something ""real life""? Just go sit at the mall for free.If Smile wanted to impress me, it should have had some twists and turns. Horror that happens to people in a just sad. Horror that happens because of your poor decisions? Horror that opens the door to the idea that you could have beaten it if you just made a different choice? That's horror. This is just tarted up gore.Watch it because Sosie Bacon takes us with her on this journey and she deserves to be seen.

Not to mention, the camera movement really added to the story and there were many unique shots. I want to write this review spoil free, so I'm going to do that.

"Trauma: Very intense emotional shock or impression caused by some negative fact or event that produces a lasting imprint on a person's subconscious that cannot or takes time to overcome.Here is a clever and disturbing horror film. Without being very original, the first work of the director and screenwriter, Parker Finn, takes elements from other films and makes them his own without falling into crude imitation.In this story I perceive a clear influence of the wonderful It Follows (2014). Both speak of a curse of an evil entity that is transmitted and spreads from one person to another adding a chain of misfortunes. In It Follows it was transmitted by sexual contact. Promiscuity made the entity strong. Here, it is the trauma of witnessing a suicide that makes the evil entity strong.As in It Follows, in Smile, only the person carrying the curse can see the identity that can present itself in multiple ways, even as if it were a known person.The plot flows with narrative solvency from the brutal opening sequence. That rarefied and disturbing atmosphere is sustained and increased as the protagonist, a psychiatrist (terrific performance by the actress, Sosie Bacon) falls into a spiral of confusion and uncertainty as she understands what is happening to her while her loved ones begin to to believe that he has totally lost his mind.The script is very good. He makes observations about mental health and the thin line between sanity and madness in people who have faced situations of high emotional impact.It manages to shake the viewer in some very well planned moments so that they are unexpected and even the seasoned movie buff does not see them coming.The bases are given for it to have one or several sequels, since the premise and the end of the film suggest it.",trauma intense emotional shock impression caused negative fact event produce lasting imprint person subconscious cannot take time overcome clever disturbing horror film without original first work director screenwriter parker finn take element film make without falling crude imitation story perceive clear influence wonderful follows speak curse evil entity transmitted spread one person another adding chain misfortune follows transmitted sexual contact promiscuity made entity strong trauma witnessing suicide make evil entity strong follows smile person carrying curse see identity present multiple way even known person plot flow narrative solvency brutal opening sequence rarefied disturbing atmosphere sustained increased protagonist psychiatrist terrific performance actress sosie bacon fall spiral confusion uncertainty understands happening loved one begin believe totally lost mind script good make observation mental health thin line sanity madness people faced situation high emotional impact manages shake viewer well planned moment unexpected even seasoned movie buff see coming base given one several sequel since premise end film suggest
"I thought that up to the 43min mark the movie was good. Like how they exicuted her going crazy was done well but other the story keept droping and picking up. Plus they the demon looked. It just was not scary. And the ending was so pradictable, Like they should have ended the film where as soon as she exits the ""apartment"" but its really the house. She then relizes she is stuck there with the demon then she screams and the screen cuts to black. Thats how I would have written the ending. It would have been such a good twits that they could have left it open for a second film.

"I'll give it a 6 because it is very well directed and acted but if you're being honest, the best of it is borrowed from other movies which makes it lack originality.It's OK for a movie to share references and similarities but some of the shots are directly replicated from other directors, like the distorted neck scene is an import from Aterrados. I just couldn't get past this.Other similarities have been mentioned. Even the smile thing could make you feel you are watching a ''truth or dare'' remake at first. Giant guy coming out the door frame escaped from It Follows only in a less creepy manner.However, these appropriations were nicely curated. I'll give them that - I'd rather have interesting elements that are borrowed than the usual clich√©s that no longer have any effect on the viewer. They had a clear direction with this so I guess I would have expected to see more from it, it's always a bit of a let down to see they could have brought something new to the table but for some reason they didn't.",give well directed acted honest best borrowed movie make lack originality ok movie share reference similarity shot directly replicated director like distorted neck scene import aterrados get past similarity mentioned even smile thing could make feel watching truth dare remake first giant guy coming door frame escaped follows le creepy manner however appropriation nicely curated give rather interesting element borrowed usual clich longer effect viewer clear direction guess would expected see always bit let see could brought something new table reason
"Smile was good! The score really stood out, it was full of suspense, and it even made me jump a few times (and scream once ü§£). It's hard for any movie to make me jump at all, since I watch so many horror movies. The acting really stood out too, and the movie itself has a deep theme behind it that people may or may not interpret while watching.A lot of people are comparing it to It Follows, and while it definitely has some similarities with that and other movies, I enjoyed this better.

I remember watching ""Are you afraid of the dark"" as a kid and i personally would say that some of those were more thought out and made better than this movie.Not recommended to watch and not especially not in the cinema really low budget and not worth the rating given.

"Very mediocre horror movie. It fails to deliver on horror, on story, on characters, on gore to name a few.It feels like they tried to cram everything in it while trying to make the movie in neutral style. At some moments you can feel they tried to make it feel like something real, but then they absolutely fail at choosing correct or meaningful cinematography.And of course only true horror they could reproduce was musical buildup and jump scare. Cheapest and saddest trick in the book. Considering there's only like 5 jump scare throughout the movie, they try to save the horror aspect by introducing gore in it, which while playing in favor for neutrality feeling just throws you off. It's not enough.Story is suffering from personality disorder - it jumps from relationship solving to childhood traumas to investigations... Each aspect was introduced decently but since it only was there for 5 minutes at max it just feels like a jigsaw puzzle which has been assembled from many different sets. While individually gore, horror, storytelling could bring enjoyment, it all creates a very mediocre horror movie which will fail to live up to expectations of avid horror movie fans.The ""entity"" which haunts protagonist, not to say more, is so poorly made the end was almost on the level of some horror parody.. And the open ended approach to the ending in my opinion works only when you leave enough for the viewer to ponder about. Here it's very clear what will happen and basically renders the whole storyline useless in the full picture of the universe the movie is in.",mediocre horror movie fails deliver horror story character gore name feel like tried cram everything trying make movie neutral style moment feel tried make feel like something real absolutely fail choosing correct meaningful cinematography course true horror could reproduce musical buildup jump scare cheapest saddest trick book considering like jump scare throughout movie try save horror aspect introducing gore playing favor neutrality feeling throw enough story suffering personality disorder jump relationship solving childhood trauma investigation aspect introduced decently since minute max feel like jigsaw puzzle assembled many different set individually gore horror storytelling could bring enjoyment creates mediocre horror movie fail live expectation avid horror movie fan entity haunt protagonist say poorly made end almost level horror parody open ended approach ending opinion work leave enough viewer ponder clear happen basically render whole storyline useless full picture universe movie
"You know a horror movie is genuinely bad when people in the cinema could not stop laughing.The movie had effectively rehashed a number of clich√©s and concepts from other shows and movies, and amalgamated them within a plotless sequence of events.The movie fails to deliver a genuine storyline, as backstory was scattered and fragmented across a series of random flashbacks, which the writers presumed would create some form of story sequence, but failed to do that ultimately.The movie basically consisted of: 60% slow scenes with weird music, 20% close-up scenes of hallucinations, 10% random memory flashbacks, and 10% cheap jump-scares that mimic what has been already seen in previous movies.Without going into spoilers, the movie has taken the horror elements from the plot of Stranger Things, and then re-hashed them into a cheap and inferior knock-off.Smile (2022) is one of those movies where people leave the cinema pulling their hair out wishing they had just stayed at home and watched Netflix.0/10

"Good soundtrack, pretty good start of the story, but too long and obvious ending. One-time movie with no actual horrifying moments except for those with loud sound. Watch it at home and it's basically ""Truth or Dare"" with a bit longer and boring timeline. Good horror movie shoud be horryfying even without a sound, this one has a few good moments, but the rest of the horror is just a cliche. Although I admit that soundtrack is really good and first half of the film is really promising, but the ending is rather boring (probably because you waited for too long).

"The basic premise is pretty decent: The witness to suffering, mental illness, trauma becomes a ""carrier"" of that suffering, illness, trauma. But rather than fully committing to an exploration of this theme, ""Smile"" ends up using it as a simple plot device for an investigative horror story. In the process, the writer-director often injects into the events some rather insensitive (and cliched) depictions of mental illness, and loved-ones' reactions to illness, that do little to help the narrative and do quite a bit to discredit it.Sosie Bacon plays the increasingly troubled Dr. Rose Cotter who, as a clinical psychologist, is a witness to a suicide. She carries nearly 100% of the resulting screen time in a suitable, if not entirely credible, manner. Most of the movie is about Rose's attempts to piece together the ""chain"" of trauma in which each victim/perpetrator to suicide becomes a ""link"" for more acts of violence, And as a protagonist-investigator, Bacon is fine.However, Rose is also a victim; and it is in that capacity that she is surprisingly unsympathetic. Part of that is a script problem - specifically, an inability by the director to decide if we are witnessing a manifestation of childhood trauma experienced by Rose or an ""actual"" possession. But it is also a reflection of the somewhat flat and cold delivery of the actress. Bacon was an odd choice for this role.The other characters hardly fare better: Kyle Gallner's ""Joel"" and Kal Penn's (brief) role as Dr. Desai are the only convincing characters. The other important characters (the fiance, Rose's sister, Rose's therapist) are so hastily introduced, sketched and released that it was hard to determine what role, exactly, each was there to play other than providing exaggerated, and somewhat mean-spirited, reactions to Rose' predicament.By the time we reach the last twenty or so minutes, it is clear that the writer/director has abandoned any commitment to ""Smile"" as a Hitchcockian study of psychological breakdown. By that point, the turn is toward a straight-forward horror story. As a result, the ending to the movie was more than a little unsatisfying in view of the two hour viewing commitment.",basic premise pretty decent witness suffering mental illness trauma becomes carrier suffering illness trauma rather fully committing exploration theme smile end using simple plot device investigative horror story process writer director often injects event rather insensitive cliched depiction mental illness loved one reaction illness little help narrative quite bit discredit sosie bacon play increasingly troubled dr rose cotter clinical psychologist witness suicide carry nearly resulting screen time suitable entirely credible manner movie rose attempt piece together chain trauma victim perpetrator suicide becomes link act violence protagonist investigator bacon fine however rose also victim capacity surprisingly unsympathetic part script problem specifically inability director decide witnessing manifestation childhood trauma experienced rose actual possession also reflection somewhat flat cold delivery actress bacon odd choice role character hardly fare better kyle gallner joel kal penn brief role dr desai convincing character important character fiance rose sister rose therapist hastily introduced sketched released hard determine role exactly play providing exaggerated somewhat mean spirited reaction rose predicament time reach last twenty minute clear writer director abandoned commitment smile hitchcockian study psychological breakdown point turn toward straight forward horror story result ending movie little unsatisfying view two hour viewing commitment

"This movie wasn't particularly special in any way. It relied heavily on jump scares that were more annoying than scary.

There's no character development or cause behind a lot of her actions.

"'Smile' is a 2022 psychological horror film written and directed by Paker Finn, in his directorial debut, and is based on his own short film. The movie stars Sosie Bacon as a therapist who starts undergoing a supernatural experience after seeing a patient commit suicide. The cast are lesser known actors with the most famous supporting cast member probably being Kal Penn. 'Smile' was originally set to be released on the Paramount+ streaming platform, but was granted a theatrical release following positive test screenings. The movie made over $200 million on just a $17 million dollar budget.Sosie Bacon plays Rose Cotter and when a patient kills herself in front of Rose it begins a bizarre chain of events that may lead to her grisly demise. She starts seeing things that no one else can see. The most prominent vision, which her last patient described to her, has to do with seeing people and entities smiling at her vacantly. The smile and vacant look carry with them both emptiness and malevolence. We learn that there appears to be a chain as a person kills themselves gruesomely in front of another and then that next person starts displaying aberrant behavior until they wind up committing the same act in front of another person. Rose mentally spirals as she questions everything, and friends and family shun her as her behavior becomes more and more erratic and uncharacteristic. In the end she must attempt to figure out what is causing this and discern if there is any way she can derail it before she becomes the next in this gruesome sequence.This movie is a mildly entertaining escape, but lacks a decently rationale plot, and its greatest sin is that it is wildly derivative. How is this movie not just a lesser rehash of 'It Follows'? It is the same mysterious, unknowable entity killing like a chain letter. The only difference is that movie was much more intelligent about how it told its story with more interesting, believable characters. In 'Smile' the writer/director does an awful job of believably executing Rose's downward spiral. Really it is not so much her downward spiral as it is everyone's reaction to her. There is zero sympathy from friends and family which is a pretty cruddy way to treat someone whether they are having legitimate mental issues or a genuine haunting. I never believed the relationship Rose had with her fiance as he takes the first opportunity to turn his back on her as she runs to a former boyfriend who just happens to be a cop that can get her all the intel she needs to move the plot forward. Rose for her part does a horrible job at getting any sort of point across regarding her situation despite the fact she should understand all this as a therapist. Instead she just comes across like a raving lunatic having a mental break. The end had a chance to redeem itself, but instead goes for a pretty standard horror ending for this day age which will just allow for sequels should the studio deem they will make enough money. 'Smile' just doesn't give horror lovers much to smile about as it is an average film that is too derivative with a decided lack of horror flair, intelligence or originality.Eric's Grade: D+",smile psychological horror film written directed paker finn directorial debut based short film movie star sosie bacon therapist start undergoing supernatural experience seeing patient commit suicide cast lesser known actor famous supporting cast member probably kal penn smile originally set released paramount streaming platform granted theatrical release following positive test screening movie made million million dollar budget sosie bacon play rose cotter patient kill front rose begin bizarre chain event may lead grisly demise start seeing thing one else see prominent vision last patient described seeing people entity smiling vacantly smile vacant look carry emptiness malevolence learn appears chain person kill gruesomely front another next person start displaying aberrant behavior wind committing act front another person rose mentally spiral question everything friend family shun behavior becomes erratic uncharacteristic end must attempt figure causing discern way derail becomes next gruesome sequence movie mildly entertaining escape lack decently rationale plot greatest sin wildly derivative movie lesser rehash follows mysterious unknowable entity killing like chain letter difference movie much intelligent told story interesting believable character smile writer director awful job believably executing rose downward spiral really much downward spiral everyone reaction zero sympathy friend family pretty cruddy way treat someone whether legitimate mental issue genuine haunting never believed relationship rose fiance take first opportunity turn back run former boyfriend happens cop get intel need move plot forward rose part horrible job getting sort point across regarding situation despite fact understand therapist instead come across like raving lunatic mental break end chance redeem instead go pretty standard horror ending day age allow sequel studio deem make enough money smile give horror lover much smile average film derivative decided lack horror flair intelligence originality eric grade

"Smile was awesome. It's not anything ground breaking, but if you want to experience a slick-scarefest you can't go wrong with Smile. I agree there are a lot of jump scares, and I understand if that is not your thing. The jump scares are well placed, and part of the fun is guessing when the scares will come. At least for me, and when the scares do come some were predictable, but many other scenes were pretty unsettling, unpredictable, suspenseful and quite scary. Sosie Bacon does a tremendous job carrying the movie on her shoulders. Bacon displaying convincing emotions to the chaos she is enduring. The ending was awesome in my opinion as well.

"I loved that I had no idea what this entity was for a good chunk of the movie. Where it comes from, why it's here.I loved the pacing, characters, and the uniqueness of this story. I watch A LOT of supernatural horror from various cultures and I hadn't yet come across a plot where an entity or curse passes from one victim to the other by the necessitation of someone bearing witness to suicides. For this I was intrigued.I also loved the underlying theme about trauma and healing. We heal when we face the trauma, not by slapping a fake smile, not by trying to leave it all behind without appropriate interventions, and not by becoming a workaholic.I loved the storyline between the sisters and how they each dealt with the trauma of their mother's physical abuse and mental illness. I enjoyed the lead character facing her mother and relieving herself from the guilt of not saving the woman who continually abused her.I was WITH the movie until....1. The cop getting the curse and witnessing the lead's suicide at the end was PREDICTABLE! I called it 2/3 through the movie so when it did end up happening I was disappointed. I woulda better enjoyed not seeing the ending coming. With the trauma theme and subplots explored above, the filmmakers could've created a seriously juicy and unpredictable ending. Maybe they ran out of time and/or budget but this ending was not awesome.2. They showed the entity! And it looked ridiculous, particularly the bumbling giant mother (this reminded me of Bill Skaargard's IT movies) and especially that naked giant with 5 mouths opening the woman's mouth and climbing in. We know it's a possession that happens, why cheapen the experience by showing this creature that although disturbing looking, made me roll my eyes and yawn. That woulda been better left to the viewer's imagination. Case in point, one of the things that made BIRD BOX work so well is that you never actually see what the creatures look like. They intimate with mysterious drawings of the creatures , but leave it to our imagination.Had it not been for the predictable ending and the entity revealed, I prolly woulda given this movie a 10.You know what? After writing this review and realizing how much material they had to play with that they didn't use to create a kickass ending, I'm thinking of reducing my score to a 7.

"Smile reviewI entered this movie with high expectations, which I really try to avoid. I had heard it compared to the likes of the Black Phone, which I personally consider my favorite horror/thriller movie of 2022. Ultimately, I left the theater pleased but also realizing that it could have been better.Smile is more of a psychological horror film. The terror of what this entity is that is following our protagonist provides for a lot of suspenseful moments. There are jump scares, of course, but I don't necessarily find it bad.My favorite part of the movie was a mix of the cinematography with the sound design. I can't express how, but the sounds seemed to fit in with everything going on. And the way the camera moved and showed things on screen definitely adds to the feeling of confusion you're supposed to have.Where the film falls short for me is in the ambiguity of the entity and in the ending. I feel like more could have been done to explain the rules of the creature. In a movie like ""It Follows,"" we may not know much about the creature but we're at least familiar with the rules and how to (potentially) defeat it. In Smile, we really don't see a solid resolution of the conflict. I felt like the ending would have been fine in the final apartment confrontation, but the ""second"" ending really just felt tacked on and unnecessary.Overall, it will provide some good scares and I think horror fans will be entertained, but I also don't see it as my favorite movie of the year.",smile reviewi entered movie high expectation really try avoid heard compared like black phone personally consider favorite horror thriller movie ultimately left theater pleased also realizing could better smile psychological horror film terror entity following protagonist provides lot suspenseful moment jump scare course necessarily find bad favorite part movie mix cinematography sound design express sound seemed fit everything going way camera moved showed thing screen definitely add feeling confusion supposed film fall short ambiguity entity ending feel like could done explain rule creature movie like follows may know much creature least familiar rule potentially defeat smile really see solid resolution conflict felt like ending would fine final apartment confrontation second ending really felt tacked unnecessary overall provide good scare think horror fan entertained also see favorite movie year
"Interesting idea. Very badly executed... many jump scares that were predictable. The storyline was all over the place. The investigation dead ends were just pure stupidity. To top it off it seems that the budget ended mid movie because the effects and final ""scary"" scenes were worse than a pre-school play. The reason why the evaluation is 2 stars is due to the fact that the first part of the movie until the first death was interesting. The one positive take from the movie was the good performance of Sosie bacon, who even though the bad script was able to creat some sort of intrigue, making the viewer feel at least happy to see a good actress performing.",interesting idea badly executed many jump scare predictable storyline place investigation dead end pure stupidity top seems budget ended mid movie effect final scary scene worse pre school play reason evaluation star due fact first part movie first death interesting one positive take movie good performance sosie bacon even though bad script able creat sort intrigue making viewer feel least happy see good actress performing
"The marketing campaign was a looooot better than the movie, but let's be honest, I knew it even before I saw the movie. If you haven't seen it, they put actors in sport's games, smiling with their mouths but not their eyes (which make them very creepy), hoping they would get noticed and that people would run watch the movie. Halloween being around the corner, and the movie coming out, I had to try it, though I didn't expect much. Let's be honest, if you like horror movies, and have watched several of them, you will not be surprised by ANY of the jump scares, that appear exactly where and when you expect them. I would put the acting as an ""horror movie acting"", meaning that the actors are surely good (I did see a few of them in other movies/series), but are not directed in the best way. The tropes are pretty classic, a woman sees things that others don't, she gets more and more crazy, and you know the rest. Still a popcorn movie though, that you could probably enjoy at home a lot more.",marketing campaign looooot better movie let honest knew even saw movie seen put actor sport game smiling mouth eye make creepy hoping would get noticed people would run watch movie halloween around corner movie coming try though expect much let honest like horror movie watched several surprised jump scare appear exactly expect would put acting horror movie acting meaning actor surely good see movie series directed best way trope pretty classic woman see thing others get crazy know rest still popcorn movie though could probably enjoy home lot
"I watched this movie with low expectations and I was right. This movie was disappointing and there were parts in the movie that were supposed to be ""scary"" but I found it funny. I felt like the smiling and creepy scenes were executed poorly and it shows.It's not the fault of the actors. It's more on the directing on how to make good horror. And that is not this movie.Don't even try to get me started with jumpscares. They were cheap and halfway through the movie I was honestly bored out of my mind because it felt like the movie wasn't going anywhere with its plot. It's like they're not trying anymore.The only time I got interested is when they gave the backstory regarding the Protagonist's past, but after that it was back to me yawning and just wanting the movie to end.And the ending... God, what did they do with the ending? It's the generic horror trope, but the credits song was just... odd. Why they made the decision to make the credits have a song like that? I will never know.I did like the upside down shots so that's a plus for my rating I guess.3/10.

"Very excieting movie ,you never feel bored all the time you watch it . Alot of jump scares and many mysteries inside the movie. The best thing i liked in the film is that no distractions or dialogues that take the audience away from the story line.

Ireally recommend it to whom like the horror movies and i think it the best film to watch in hallowen .the things i didnt like in the film are its duration, i was so tired after it ended (iam joking hahaha), for the nonhorror movies fans ,i recommend watching it at cinema or with your friends.",excieting movie never feel bored time watch alot jump scare many mystery inside movie best thing liked film distraction dialogue take audience away story line really also felt excietement like ring sinister acting quality execellent sound effect pretty good ireally recommend like horror movie think best film watch hallowen thing didnt like film duration tired ended iam joking hahaha nonhorror movie fan recommend watching cinema friend
Four Days could have produced much more. The horrifying premise was not lived up to by the last two days Rose spent under the influence. Smile's theme is absolutely terrifying and what's remarkable is the production has added excellent visuals and creepy background audio. Cinematography is of the highest quality along with the great colour schemes that shout out chaos. Amazing work by the cast performing the complex encounters perfectly. Smile manages to put up a great metaphorical display of the horrors manifested by historic trauma. Fragility of the mind and social relationships it's all discussed with good twist of horror in this movie.,four day could produced much horrifying premise lived last two day rose spent influence smile theme absolutely terrifying remarkable production added excellent visuals creepy background audio cinematography highest quality along great colour scheme shout chaos amazing work cast performing complex encounter perfectly smile manages put great metaphorical display horror manifested historic trauma fragility mind social relationship discussed good twist horror movie

"Ahead of watching this movie, and having read the plot, seen the poster and felt the echoes of the title, I had the belief it was going to be some psycho-kind or so of horror movie, and I didn't expect what I found watching it. The movie is in the realm of supernatural horror, and it really excels at what it does. It's never boring start to end, and the build-up of tension is there throughout and keeps punishing you in the way a horror movie experience should. The film has a tone of its own, and though the horror recipes may seem familiar to other modern horror, the atmosphere feels different and the net effect is a distinctive movie with a fairly unique feel. The characters are not exactly charismatic, but still authentic enough nevertheless and feel real. I really recommend this movie for horror lovers; and mind you here: it's really scary, like ""really"" I mean.",ahead watching movie read plot seen poster felt echo title belief going psycho kind horror movie expect found watching movie realm supernatural horror really excels never boring start end build tension throughout keep punishing way horror movie experience film tone though horror recipe may seem familiar modern horror atmosphere feel different net effect distinctive movie fairly unique feel character exactly charismatic still authentic enough nevertheless feel real really recommend movie horror lover mind really scary like really mean
"I enjoyed the fact this movie wasn't an overly bloody chop fest, but rather a psychological creepy freaky film with a few jump scares and unexpected surprises. For a horror film it's actually not half bad. I did have low expectations, and the ending was relatively expected for me - but still it could have been far worse. True I did feel like the trailer exposed a little but too much of the film but I would still tell horror fans to give it an opportunity. I also was wondering if the ending was allowing for a sequel which is another possibility; other reviews didn't seem to like the ending. Try it and see if you like it.",enjoyed fact movie overly bloody chop fest rather psychological creepy freaky film jump scare unexpected surprise horror film actually half bad low expectation ending relatively expected still could far worse true feel like trailer exposed little much film would still tell horror fan give opportunity also wondering ending allowing sequel another possibility review seem like ending try see like
"Is this a perfect movie? No. But I will say, as an avid horror fan, that this one has been the first in years that genuinely made me feel unsettled watching it. Some of the jump scares were predictable, but most were very sneaky and totally got me. The acting by the lead especially was well done; it was easy to feel her despair as days passed and she tried to figure things out.It reminds me a bit of It Follows in the sense that there's this ""thing"" going from person to person, sometimes taking on the appearance of someone you know, and sometimes not.It's not that often you see the protagonist lose (they always seem to figure it out just in time ðŸ™„), and it was actually refreshing.",perfect movie say avid horror fan one first year genuinely made feel unsettled watching jump scare predictable sneaky totally got acting lead especially well done easy feel despair day passed tried figure thing reminds bit follows sense thing going person person sometimes taking appearance someone know sometimes often see protagonist lose always seem figure time actually refreshing
"First, the acting of Bacon is awesome. I cannot wait to see her in more films. She's a mix of Hilary Swank and someone else that I can't put my finger on.The movie is NOTHING without the eery music and about 4 predictable jump scares. The biggest problem with the movie is that it wants you to be on the edge of your seat waiting for a jump scare the ENTIRE movie, but the scares actually never come. And when the maybe 4 predictable jumps do come, they are totally laughable.The whole movie is totally predictable, and offers nothing new and certainly nothing scary. Mix up FALLEN, The Ring, It Follows, and about a dozen other movies and then make it a parody/comedy and that's what this is.

"Smile had a very interesting and innovative marketing campaign prior to the launch of the film, but that's where the innovation stopped. The rest of the movie was very paint by the numbers psychological thriller with a sinister force controlling people and turning them insane. The CGI used in the movie wasn't particularly good or believable and took away some of the horror or scare factor for me.Most of the movie was very generic and serviceable , the one interesting part that engaged me was how to solve the problem and end the cycle of horror but by the end the trope of ""you are powerless against evil"" popped up again and it kinda made the last 30 minutes of the film feel rather pointless, a trope that i'm hoping we'll see less and less of since it's getting tired.",smile interesting innovative marketing campaign prior launch film innovation stopped rest movie paint number psychological thriller sinister force controlling people turning insane cgi used movie particularly good believable took away horror scare factor movie generic serviceable one interesting part engaged solve problem end cycle horror end trope powerless evil popped kinda made last minute film feel rather pointless trope hoping see le le since getting tired

"With it coming up to Halloween, and having seen the adverts/ previews many times, I was quite looking forward to this film.This film has been made before but in the form of 'It follows'. The difference being I enjoyed 'It follows' and maybe just the thought of watching something similar was enough to make this film seem worse than it actually was. I don't know and maybe never will as I won't be rushing to watch it again.What I do know is that if you want to be shocked or horrified, you have to have missed the adverts for the film. They literally put all of the 'seat jumping' bits in the adverts so there was so little left to shock me. Combine this with the storyline that resembled 'It follows' so much, it was like I had seen it before. So you get to the end of the film hoping they may have satisfactorily rounded it off. But no.

"For all those who are still undecided and want to check out other ratings. This is a truly great horror movie. Since even the best horror movie will not get over a 7 on imdb.This movie shows how simplicity can be so complex. There is much more to this movie as the obvious scare scenes in the movie.

"First let me say I loved the marketing strategy of paying actors to sit behind home plate at MLB games and smile maniacally. Brilliant move. Smile hits the ground running, setting the tone within the first 15 minutes. Avid horror fans will draw two comparisons to two other great horror films which I will not mention for sake of spoiling the plot. Worth mentioning I loved the two original premises this borrowed from and felt this was an original ""borrowing"" if you will. Smile was thoroughly creepy in both premise, cinematography and well placed jump scares. The acting was great all around with the exception of the main actress's fiancÃ©. Not sure if that was on purpose or not but his character was not well written and easy to dislike. The ending was somewhat predictable and yet I loved it. This was the first horror movie to genuinely scare me since Sinister back in 2012. I had nightmares the first night after viewing.

"From its haunting visuals to its spine-tingling soundtrack, ""SMILE"" delivers a truly unsettling experience that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats.The heroine battles her own inner demons while confronting the malevolent force that torments her.Supporting character provide both moral support and skepticism, adding layers of tension and uncertainty to the narrative. The performances of the supporting cast are commendable, effectively enhancing the overall sense of fear and unease.One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the use of plenty of drone shots and long wide angle shots that heighten the tension and amplify the psychological impact of the story.The film's sound design plays a crucial role in intensifying the horror. From the haunting whispers that echo through empty corridors to the jarring sound effects that accompany each terrifying encounter, the auditory experience of ""SMILE"" is unsettling to the core. The score, composed by a master of suspense, expertly builds suspense and unease, enhancing the overall sense of dread throughout the film.""SMILE"" jumps into themes of trauma, mental health, and the power of the subconscious mind. Through its chilling narrative, the film explores the devastating effects that unresolved trauma can have on an individual's psyche. The symbolism of the smiling man represents the inner demons and fears that lurk within us all, and the film serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of facing one's past.""SMILE"" is a must-watch horror film for fans of psychological thrillers that takes you on a haunting journey into the darkest corners of the human mind...",haunting visuals spine tingling soundtrack smile delivers truly unsettling experience leave audience edge seat heroine battle inner demon confronting malevolent force torment supporting character provide moral support skepticism adding layer tension uncertainty narrative performance supporting cast commendable effectively enhancing overall sense fear unease one impressive aspect film use plenty drone shot long wide angle shot heighten tension amplify psychological impact story film sound design play crucial role intensifying horror haunting whisper echo empty corridor jarring sound effect accompany terrifying encounter auditory experience smile unsettling core score composed master suspense expertly build suspense unease enhancing overall sense dread throughout film smile jump theme trauma mental health power subconscious mind chilling narrative film explores devastating effect unresolved trauma individual psyche symbolism smiling man represents inner demon fear lurk within u film serf cautionary tale importance facing one past smile must watch horror film fan psychological thriller take haunting journey darkest corner human mind
"A familiar story told in a very boring way which is camouflaged by constant unnecessary jump scares and other tricks in the book of a filmmaker who has nothing to say.The main character is portrayed in a manner that borders on comedy almost slapstick. She is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Screaming, crying, jumping around like a lunatic, breaking things just from the beginning. It makes any form of progression impossible so there's never any real suspense or tension just senseless technical scares. The performance is really hard to endure and the rest of the cast doesn't help much either.Even if you think you have to watch every horror movie out there (like me unfortunately), do yourself a favor and skip this one.

"Had the right amount of jump scares (some films have way too many). Loved the premise, especially how the curse uses trauma as it's catalyst. The acting from all the actors were great, particularly the leading lady. She depicted a breakdown perfectly, showing all the signs of someone having a traumatic episode.While I would love a sequel where we could see someone finally breaking the curse (maybe the nice policeman), I'm quite content knowing there's nothing to be done about this spirit. I guess we have to accept that the cycle will continue forever.

"When I first heard the premise I thoughout it would be a sequel to Truth Or Dare movie or something. Then when it came out I saw some lofty reviews, so I decided to check it out.First up, I'm not the biggest horror movie fan, since most just use loud noises to jumpscare you, instead of actually being creepy and scary. This movie (un)fortunately is both. The start and later the build up is really scary, intense and intriguing and I found myself looking for smiling people in the back- and foreground. That's when movies are the most creepy you know. When you're seeing things in the background and you wonder whether you're looking at the 'monster' or not. This movie has those moments which I really enjoying. But this movie also has jumpscares, lots of them.

"""It Follows"" is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The premise of a threat always moving toward you and the exploration of the protagonist convincing people that the situation is very real and very dangerous felt fresh at the time. Smile takes this exact premise but focuses more on the social dynamic of trying to convince people our protagonist isn't crazy.Smile suffers from being one of the most formularic horrors I have seen in the last few years. It was to the point that you could predict which seen would certainly have a jump scare and when. Also of note, the jump scares were often cheap and there for the sake of the jump scare. The movie is carried by it's interesting yet copied premise, its stellar cinematography and sound design, and a great performance by Ms. Bacon. This is one to catch when it comes to a streaming platform and skip the theatre.",follows one favorite horror movie time premise threat always moving toward exploration protagonist convincing people situation real dangerous felt fresh time smile take exact premise focus social dynamic trying convince people protagonist crazy smile suffers one formularic horror seen last year point could predict seen would certainly jump scare also note jump scare often cheap sake jump scare movie carried interesting yet copied premise stellar cinematography sound design great performance m bacon one catch come streaming platform skip theatre

"Unfortunately every other scene had already been shown in the trailers and the ""twists"" were seen a mile off, too predictable. As for the sound design? I'm not sure what to say other than I've heard them in other films and it's just not that great. Lots of plot holes in the film and the only reason I've given it two stars instead of one is it felt more like a comedy with how it made me and other people in the screening laugh at it during peak ""horror"" moments. So would I recommend it? If you want to laugh or fall asleep, sure otherwise no I wouldn't.

"Completely devoid of originality. At any given scene in the movie you can tell which movie they're trying to rip off (although it's mostly copying The Ring and it Follows) so the tone of the film is completely schizophrenic with no consistent style or personality of its own.It also doesn't help that the only ""original"" scare of the movie boils down to ""hey that person suddenly has a derpy smile"" (which comes off as humorous most of the time) There's also jumpscares. LOTS of jumpscares. None of them feel impactful or shocking at all, but at least there's a lot of them.But the biggest crux of this movie is its characters. There are none. Smile's idea of ""character development"" is either giving a character a funny one-liner and cutting away immediately; or giving a character a dead relative that they feel sad about. Halfway through the movie, my family tried to name a single character trait from any of the characters. We couldn't come up with a single one.

The Big Baddie was the regular horror Monster, skinny and walking funny like other Monsters like in REC and Mama.I know the director is New and is probably trying to find the rythim to his own flow and How he wants to direct but there where some not alot of clichÃªs and also some cÃ¢mera bits probably influenced by other classic horror directores like Sam Raimi.A decent begining but still way behind the other New directores like Jordann Peel and Ari Aster
A movie to see with your friends in a saturday afternoon.

"I think the makers of this film watched It Follows and decided - hey, look, cool film, simple concept, nothing much happening but its so scary and everyone loves it. Lets do something similar but with more scary jumpy gory stuff, we sure could have an even better film with no effort at all! Lets just build a whole story on one single concept - a scary smile! That should be enough.As a result, with have this corny mess: an incoherent tale of random possession by something that, when revealed, looked like a huge tranny in underpants; masses of screaming; blood, monsters - but despite all these the film is not scary at all, just annoying. The filmmakers did not even manage to recreate the same lingering horror It Follows achieves: the scenes with with their spooky smiling people never last long enough, the characters do/ say too much - this creates a distraction and removes any potentially scary uncanny atmosphere in favour of cheap jump scares and gore.The main character, Rose, doesn't help, she is really irritating and very hard to feel sympathetic for. Which brings me on to the next point I found terrible about this film - I really don't get why Rose was shown to act like she did. I thought the whole point of these kind of stories is for the main character to be totally normal, perhaps a little fazed but still ok. They encounter some sketchy stuff no one can see, so while everyone around them questioning their sanity and judgement, us, the viewers, know what's happening all along and can see that their actions are completely reasonable. But here, all we can see is that Rose is clearly nuts. She looks nuts, she acts nuts, she is a gasping, sweaty, screaming mess. There is nothing rational about her. She constantly overreacts, and is more fragile than pregnant Rosemary - despite being a psychiatrist. It doesn't help that, probably due to bad lighting, she somehow looks 20 in once scene, and 60 in the next - this makes her look even more unhinged.I did wonder - maybe I missed something, and this was not a horror film at all, but a psychological thriller about madness? There was a crazy mum storyline, and some sort of indication that Rose killed her, maybe the monster was some sort of representation of her inner turmoil? Did Rose really kill her cat and gave it to her little nephew? But I somehow doubt this film is this deep. I did not enjoy it, I think it was a waste of time.",think maker film watched follows decided hey look cool film simple concept nothing much happening scary everyone love let something similar scary jumpy gory stuff sure could even better film effort let build whole story one single concept scary smile enough result corny mess incoherent tale random possession something revealed looked like huge tranny underpants mass screaming blood monster despite film scary annoying filmmaker even manage recreate lingering horror follows achieves scene spooky smiling people never last long enough character say much creates distraction remove potentially scary uncanny atmosphere favour cheap jump scare gore main character rose help really irritating hard feel sympathetic brings next point found terrible film really get rose shown act like thought whole point kind story main character totally normal perhaps little fazed still ok encounter sketchy stuff one see everyone around questioning sanity judgement u viewer know happening along see action completely reasonable see rose clearly nut look nut act nut gasping sweaty screaming mess nothing rational constantly overreacts fragile pregnant rosemary despite psychiatrist help probably due bad lighting somehow look scene next make look even unhinged wonder maybe missed something horror film psychological thriller madness crazy mum storyline sort indication rose killed maybe monster sort representation inner turmoil rose really kill cat gave little nephew somehow doubt film deep enjoy think waste time
It didn't have the scariest jump scares or horrific suspense but it did have an original plot.So many horror films are based on a killer killing or a demon haunting. It was enjoyable and refreshing to watch a horror movie with a plot I haven't seen in dozens of other films.Also the soundtrack and background music was pretty chilling along with the nightmare inducing smiles.I also liked how the ending played out. It wasn't what we usually see or expect in a horror film and honestly liked that it didn't give me what I wanted yet still felt like a satisfying conclusion.Great Film. Would definitely recommend.,scariest jump scare horrific suspense original plot many horror film based killer killing demon haunting enjoyable refreshing watch horror movie plot seen dozen film also soundtrack background music pretty chilling along nightmare inducing smile also liked ending played usually see expect horror film honestly liked give wanted yet still felt like satisfying conclusion great film would definitely recommend
"I must say, haven seen a lot of horror films in my life time, Smile does a really good job of merging monster, paranormal activity and mind bending twits all in one film. It does this very well without making it feel over done thanks to the simple writing that also feels somewhat original at the same time.I was pleasantly impressed and surprised to actually jump from jump scares since films like the conjuring. The film does a very good job of taking the viewer on a ride into the main characters mind and the nuances of her hallucinations. Overall a very good watch for die hard horror fans like myself. A very well deserved 7/10.",must say seen lot horror film life time smile really good job merging monster paranormal activity mind bending twit one film well without making feel done thanks simple writing also feel somewhat original time pleasantly impressed surprised actually jump jump scare since film like conjuring film good job taking viewer ride main character mind nuance hallucination overall good watch die hard horror fan like well deserved
"The movie was going super well in the beginning in my opinion, it seemed unique and it was very well acted. Then in the middle I was getting a bit disappointed by the cliches in the story, and I had felt like I had seen plenty of stories similar to this one. It's very similar to movies like the Ring, where you are cursed and are researching previous victims of the curse to try and save yourself. I was getting a bit bored, but I wanted to finish the film. I think what really saved my interest was the last few minutes of the film. I wouldn't say the ending was unique, but it defintely was portrayed well in a horrifying fashion. This film is definitely worth watching, just don't expect a masterpiece of horror cinema.",movie going super well beginning opinion seemed unique well acted middle getting bit disappointed cliche story felt like seen plenty story similar one similar movie like ring cursed researching previous victim curse try save getting bit bored wanted finish film think really saved interest last minute film say ending unique defintely portrayed well horrifying fashion film definitely worth watching expect masterpiece horror cinema
"If Blumhouse's Truth or Dare (2018) had a baby with Unsane (2018) that was raised by It Follows (2014) then as great as It Follows was it just couldn't help this mess. When the overall acting is not good that usually speaks to bad direction. When a narrative does not pay homage to the genre but merely cuts and pastes story notes haphazardly around the narrative structure (which in and of itself lacks cohesion it is lazily derivative.This may sound brutal but it needs to be said. Originality has always been rare in all genres but at the moment in this genre, it has been replaced by ultra gore and supernatural elements without regard for the fact that sometimes what is most effective is in what the director chooses not to show. Build up, shots that establish mood, a script written by a writer that knows what they want to say and a director that knows how to realize it, are all but forgotten in too many instances.

"Smile tells the story of a therapist who witnesses a patient's suicide and then a ""curse"" that seemingly begins as a result.First off - this is a story you have probably seen before. It takes elements from ""Truth or Dare"", ""Drag me to Hell"", ""The Ring"" ""It follows"" ect where we have a main character fighting against time/a curse who is made to seem crazy to everyone else.That being said - this movie is extremely well done. The visuals are terrific, some of the scares in this movies are legitimately brilliant. They never got cheesy (and it really could be with this gimmick) and I was genuinely scared/creeped out at several points. It is a great movie to turn the lights out for and get into it. It felt like they made this movie for an adult audience, not a teen demographic and it really helps the movie feel real and much more scary.There is also some great character work here. We have a protagonist who is easy to root for and well written. The movie isn't filled with dumb decisions or characters who you can't wait to get killed off. It's grounded, realistic and you end up properly invested in what you are watching.So overall this is not ground breaking but it's very well done and makes a great midnight watch!",smile tell story therapist witness patient suicide curse seemingly begin result first story probably seen take element truth dare drag hell ring follows ect main character fighting time curse made seem crazy everyone else said movie extremely well done visuals terrific scare movie legitimately brilliant never got cheesy really could gimmick genuinely scared creeped several point great movie turn light get felt like made movie adult audience teen demographic really help movie feel real much scary also great character work protagonist easy root well written movie filled dumb decision character wait get killed grounded realistic end properly invested watching overall ground breaking well done make great midnight watch
"If ""The Ring"" and ""It Follows"" had a baby, this would be a ripoff of that baby. A-Train can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. If I knew he was in this movie I would have known not to watch it. Cliché after cliché. The upside down transition shots are irrelevant to the story and out of place. I would not recommend this to anyone. I wish I could get my money back for renting this trash. Would not have finished it if I hadn't paid for it.

"I have to agree with some other reviews that as a scary movie, Smile goes off the tracks after around the middle. It hadome good jump scares in the beginning, and had the makings of a potentially intriguing storyline. It could have easily been seen through the lens of a psychological thriller, but it didn't fully develop this aspect, and let it go into a kind of half psychological interpretation. Maybe this whole movie was victim to some lazy writers who were loath to giving more depth to either the horror angle, or the psychological angle, letting the whole movie slip through some half baked version of both.Sosie Bacon, the lead actress wasn't too bad. She mostly carried the whole thing. I hope she gets some better material going forward in her career.This movie was worth watching for the first half, but you might be let down at the end.",agree review scary movie smile go track around middle hadome good jump scare beginning making potentially intriguing storyline could easily seen lens psychological thriller fully develop aspect let go kind half psychological interpretation maybe whole movie victim lazy writer loath giving depth either horror angle psychological angle letting whole movie slip half baked version sosie bacon lead actress bad mostly carried whole thing hope get better material going forward career movie worth watching first half might let end
"Wow. This movie is the ultimate of the ring-ish ""curse"" movies mainly because of its brilliant lead performance and a deep focus dedication to keeping things dark. There's no jokes in this horror movie and no one gets out unblemished. People keep talking about the jump scares but the darker themes and unforgettable imagery are what really make this memorable and the music is loud and creepy. This felt very euro to me, or at least what a modern euro horror movie might be. Highly recommended new American horror that will give you serious nightmares if you let it! Of course I'm only speaking on how it worked on me personally.

"This is actually well done movie from the beginning till the end. Pretty good acting and cast, well told story. There's a solid intrigue that offers hope of absolution, hope of overcoming the darkness - and I don't know if that's some unwritten low of the trade or something - but in the end it still unfortunately falls victim of the genre's most cliched cliches, and fails to bring something new that would not just refresh the genre, but raise it above the averageness it so willingly dives in after all. The only reason I'm giving it 6 (and not less) is because everything else was executed almost with perfection.It's pitty it ends up meaningless just like the rest of them, in the end.",actually well done movie beginning till end pretty good acting cast well told story solid intrigue offer hope absolution hope overcoming darkness know unwritten low trade something end still unfortunately fall victim genre cliched cliche fails bring something new would refresh genre raise averageness willingly dive reason giving le everything else executed almost perfection pitty end meaningless like rest end

"I attended a screening last night and I just don't understand the high scores.I feel it was made for a younger audience that believe a jump scare is what makes a horror film.The younger members of the audience who didn't look a day over 15 was reacting to every jump scare and they're MANY. It's rammed with jump scares for a bloated 2 hour run time.The last 30 minutes is hilarious
The CGI is ROTTENThe story had potential and was going well for the first 30 minutes but it's all lost in a mess cheap attempt to scare you

"I'm obsessed with horror movies. I've seen almost every single horror movie that exists and what I've learned is there are many different sub-genres that fall within the main ""Horror"" genre. Slasher, gore, thriller, ghost/possession, etc. My favorite sub-genre is possession and movies that seem as if they could actually happen. This falls under that category. It's finally a decent horror movie that gives you the creeps and has plenty of jump scares. These kind of movies are few and far between. We're lucky to get 2-3 good horror movies a year. This is one of those 2-3 good ones of 2022. It's not the Conjuring, but it's still one of the better horror movies over the last couple years. Yes, there's some things that are a little odd and overdone in the movie. In fact the whole storyline of someone smiling is quite weird, but the production of this movie was done very well. The way the camera pans across an empty room to show a person standing in the dark smiling...something about that definitely gives you the creeps!! They do good with the jump scares like the phone ringing in a tense moment and people appearing out of nowhere. The camerawork is what made this movie great! With the lack of horror movies being released, I say give it a shot. Go into it with an open mind knowing it's not the best storyline in horror, but it will definitely give you the creeps.",obsessed horror movie seen almost every single horror movie exists learned many different sub genre fall within main horror genre slasher gore thriller ghost possession etc favorite sub genre possession movie seem could actually happen fall category finally decent horror movie give creep plenty jump scare kind movie far lucky get good horror movie year one good one conjuring still one better horror movie last couple year yes thing little odd overdone movie fact whole storyline someone smiling quite weird production movie done well way camera pan across empty room show person standing dark smiling something definitely give creep good jump scare like phone ringing tense moment people appearing nowhere camerawork made movie great lack horror movie released say give shot go open mind knowing best storyline horror definitely give creep
"This rating is solely based on the category of horror movies which for me is a category funded with bad plots, dumb characters, sand other rehashed items. This was one of the best virus movies I've seen in years because it escaped most of that. I got a few chills and even a jump in my seat. I hadn't had that in many years.The only negative I have is that the last 30 minutes or so came apart a little. There were long pauses between the next scare. This could've been edited down as some scenes were unnecessary. Also the demon villain looked more like a rock band member than something scary.If definitely see it again and hope there is a sequel.",rating solely based category horror movie category funded bad plot dumb character sand rehashed item one best virus movie seen year escaped got chill even jump seat many year negative last minute came apart little long pause next scare could edited scene unnecessary also demon villain looked like rock band member something scary definitely see hope sequel

The monster at the end was lazy, not what I expected it to look like at all. Like a big version of that momo that was going round the internet a while back.

"Went in not knowing what to expect. Sadly, it's so boring. I actually find it insulting when I watch a horror film and the only ways in which it delivers as a horror are by a half-way okay but formulaic concept, a few cheap jumpscares, and some gratuitous uninspired gorey imagery. As for how good the jumpscares are: I'm pretty easily jumpscared I think but it only got one jump out of me.There were some bits I got some semblance of enjoyment out of, but sadly they were all in the trailer anyway.

"I was actually reminded to review this film because of a horror movie I recently watched. I couldn't help but compare it to this movie which is indicative of the impression that it left on me.This movie, similar to the others of its kind, uses tropes and cliches familiar to all fans of the genre. However, like any good story, it places them in new scenes and portrays them in unique ways. I would say the highlight of this movie is the climax, which should be expected yet a lot of horror seems to fall short of the suspense. What this movie does build up to, at an even and exciting pace, is an ultimate reveal that will leave you creeped out, or at least disturbed.I did also appreciate the acting paired with the portrayal of modern psychology in an otherwise paranormal story. I feel like this movie can be an archetype that future films can build off of to stay relevant and ""realistic"" in an arena that is filled with cheesy scenes.",actually reminded review film horror movie recently watched help compare movie indicative impression left movie similar others kind us trope cliche familiar fan genre however like good story place new scene portrays unique way would say highlight movie climax expected yet lot horror seems fall short suspense movie build even exciting pace ultimate reveal leave creeped least disturbed also appreciate acting paired portrayal modern psychology otherwise paranormal story feel like movie archetype future film build stay relevant realistic arena filled cheesy scene

I thought that the creature at the end is one of the scariest things I've ever seen and film. I don't know why, but it really disturbed me.

"Before watching this film, I wasn't understanding how it has gained so much popularity, as there's no famous actor in the cast and the director is debuting. Now that I watched, I still don't understand. Honestly, ""Smile"" is another generic entity horror film, and it's sad to say this in this particular case because the idea of the entity is excellent, reminded me of ""It Follows"", but it's totally different. Sosie Bacon is an oscillating protagonist, sometimes she can express genuine emotions and sometimes she appeals to exaggeration. She does not have chemistry either with Caitlin Stacy (who does her sister) or with Jessie Usher (who does her fiancé). At least her backstory is good. Her therapist, made by Robin Weigert (yes, Rose is a therapist who goes to a therapist, it's pretty normal, like, the barber has a barber), is also okay, and Kyle Gallner, who does a policeman, is possibly the only one who has chemistry with Bacon, and his face reminded me of a youtuber I watch who makes videos about minimalism. The film has a good comic timing, but it has a terrible horror timing. With two exceptions, the jumpscares are predictable (the whole story is predictable, by the way, but this is not a problem as big as in ""Hatching"" or in ""The Twin""), the ""scary"" scenes are A LOT longer than necessary (seriously, the film could have 40 to 50 minutes less), and I admit there were some moments when I almost left the theatre room in anger, I was almost giving up on the film. The third act only pads things out. Again, the idea of the entity was really good, and I think it would be better used either in a less generic script or in a short film, but in a feature film with a poor execution and generic atmosphere, scares and dialogues, nope.",watching film understanding gained much popularity famous actor cast director debuting watched still understand honestly smile another generic entity horror film sad say particular case idea entity excellent reminded follows totally different sosie bacon oscillating protagonist sometimes express genuine emotion sometimes appeal exaggeration chemistry either caitlin stacy sister jessie usher fianc least backstory good therapist made robin weigert yes rose therapist go therapist pretty normal like barber barber also okay kyle gallner policeman possibly one chemistry bacon face reminded youtuber watch make video minimalism film good comic timing terrible horror timing two exception jumpscares predictable whole story predictable way problem big hatching twin scary scene lot longer necessary seriously film could minute le admit moment almost left theatre room anger almost giving film third act pad thing idea entity really good think would better used either le generic script short film feature film poor execution generic atmosphere scare dialogue nope
"This is clearly a setup for a sequel, but please don't. Not every movie needs one, and this doesn't. There are plot holes for years! This film collapsed during the second act, and the problem was that it was too centralized on a single character with just about zero building for the rest. I watched the whole film, and it just didn't go anywhere resolution-wise. It's almost like they set it up where ""cop ex boyfriend"" is leading in the next one, but you can wrap this up, box it, and send it away. No need.This reminded me of ""It Follows"" from the jump. Go back to the drawing board. The premise of it was super creepy, but it began and ended on that exact style with nothing but a cliche of ""no one believes a crazy person"" scenes until it was beat to death.",clearly setup sequel please every movie need one plot hole year film collapsed second act problem centralized single character zero building rest watched whole film go anywhere resolution wise almost like set cop ex boyfriend leading next one wrap box send away need reminded follows jump go back drawing board premise super creepy began ended exact style nothing cliche one belief crazy person scene beat death

"Watched in on a whim and I was pleasantly surpised by what was unfolding in front of me!The story follows the therpaist Rose who's haunted by a malevolent entity that seems to spread through serial suicides. After her patient kills herself the entity latches itself onto Rose and starts haunting her.I really liked the camerawork and the backgrounds, as an artist I loved the backgrounds. Everything from the soft pinks of the hospital and the desaturated palette of Rose's house. The spaces Rose finds herself in are gloomy and lonely feeling, another detail I liked were the lack of people when Rose is outside, adding to the loneliness. The camera turnaround was a little overused though.Was the film scary? Personally I'd say yes, not everyone will agree with me but I think it was quite scary. The jumpscares did get me a few times! The scare at the birthday party after Rose's cousin discovers the cat's corpse in his presents was the one that got me the most.Even though I liked the film I couln't really understand the ending. The creature takes the form of her mom and starts chasing her down in this lanky form and later traps her in this fale reality kind of situation after Rose had supposedly killed it with fire. I was left questioning many things. Can the creature even be hurt physically? How powerful is it if it can trap people in false realities? Things like these kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. I think the ending could have worked better if the creature could have just killed Rose right then and there the moment she stepped into her mom's bedroom.Overall I liked it a lot, but there were a few things that were lacking/redundant.",watched whim pleasantly surpised unfolding front story follows therpaist rose haunted malevolent entity seems spread serial suicide patient kill entity latch onto rose start haunting really liked camerawork background artist loved background everything soft pink hospital desaturated palette rose house space rose find gloomy lonely feeling another detail liked lack people rose outside adding loneliness camera turnaround little overused though film scary personally say yes everyone agree think quite scary jumpscares get time scare birthday party rose cousin discovers cat corpse present one got even though liked film couln really understand ending creature take form mom start chasing lanky form later trap fale reality kind situation rose supposedly killed fire left questioning many thing creature even hurt physically powerful trap people false reality thing like kind left bad taste mouth think ending could worked better creature could killed rose right moment stepped mom bedroom overall liked lot thing lacking redundant
"I was thoroughly engaged and very scared for the entire film. Very spooky and exciting. Similar concept to ""It Follows"" but different enough that it's still unique.

"Can you believe that a smile can freak you out? Well,after watching this,I think it can.This movie has no clichés as the other pictures that belongs to horror genre does. It's originality is alluring. An unexpected jumpscare can come in any moment.Besides,I want to mention it's artistic goal. Apparently, it isn't a simple Hollywood-failed-to-be-a-blockbuster movie.

"In the first 15 minutes you understand the entire plot of the movie. The next 90 minutes are repeated scenes of either the main character trying to explain to people that she's not crazy, or scenes of her investigating and uncovering absolutely no new information. Those scenes are occasionally interrupted by visions with jumpscares. That's it. That's the movie.I'm really not sure what we're meant to be scared of. The smile is about as ineffective as it was in ""Truth or Dare"" and the visions don't hurt you unless you're clumsy and hurt yourself by accident.Then the ending happens and it's as generic as you can get nowadays. Smile clearly tried to take the high road in some sense and be a step above those stupid horrors with teenagers partying which is commendable. Being boring isn't better than being stupid though.",first minute understand entire plot movie next minute repeated scene either main character trying explain people crazy scene investigating uncovering absolutely new information scene occasionally interrupted vision jumpscares movie really sure meant scared smile ineffective truth dare vision hurt unless clumsy hurt accident ending happens generic get nowadays smile clearly tried take high road sense step stupid horror teenager partying commendable boring better stupid though
"Based on Parker Finn's short film, Laura Hasn't Slept, that I want to believe is actually a prequel to this movie. I like Finn's filmmaking style, so many close-up and aerial shots with captivating cinematography with careful sound and music. But unlike his well made short film, he put so many horror clichés repeatedly throughout this movie and it kinda felt annoying. I wished Caitlin Stasey was the main star of this movie, because I didn't liked Sosie Bacon's performance and I think she was miscasted in this role. The movie was so dark and disturbing. Shocking and traumatic moments filled with depressing and unbearable performances.",based parker finn short film laura slept want believe actually prequel movie like finn filmmaking style many close aerial shot captivating cinematography careful sound music unlike well made short film put many horror clich repeatedly throughout movie kinda felt annoying wished caitlin stasey main star movie liked sosie bacon performance think miscasted role movie dark disturbing shocking traumatic moment filled depressing unbearable performance
"This is probably my favorite horror release of the year so far! I was skeptical because of how much the trailer showed, but i was on the edge of my seat the whole time!! The director cast and crew did such a phenomenal job paying attention to details and showing the gradual decline of the protagonist. The lead actress put on such an amazing performance as well i cannot give enough props to her. Also, i have seen A LOT of horror movies and this one was one of the few that actually spooked me a couple times!

"I'm 14 years old and i absolutely love horror movies, the scarier the better.

"Smile is the definition of a perfect horror movie. Constant adrenaline rush. Best jump scared and surprised i've seen in a long time. A good story too considering acting in horror movies tends to be kinda sucky. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The visual and special effects were great and the lighting, dialogue and soundtrack created an incredibly disturbing and haunting feeling of anxiety and uncertainty the entire time. Really there are not many faults to point out aside from the occasional poor acting but it's easy to overlook as there is so much to appreciate.

"Story-wise, the movie is inspired by The Ring, but definitely not as good, and is heavily dependent on jumpscares and loud sounds which isn't something I fancy.The fun part of the movie comes from the investigation and detective work the main character is going through trying to figure out the reason behind what is going on.Cheap jumpscares ruined it for me, the ""Entity"" was very vague, not well defined and suffered from lazy writing. We ended up not knowing what exactly we were facing. The writers sacrificed a good story to service more and louder jumpscares.Acting was decent but some supporting characters were cartoony at best.In summary, this is a very commercial movie here for Halloween, nothing sets it apart from the rest.",story wise movie inspired ring definitely good heavily dependent jumpscares loud sound something fancy fun part movie come investigation detective work main character going trying figure reason behind going cheap jumpscares ruined entity vague well defined suffered lazy writing ended knowing exactly facing writer sacrificed good story service louder jumpscares acting decent supporting character cartoony best summary commercial movie halloween nothing set apart rest
"It was a quality movie to be sure with really no well-known actors. Which I like. Give other actors a shot, I'm sure there are plenty of good ones who deserve it.I was hoping to see some cool twists that I didn't anticipate, but it was very predictable and the ending was lame. I knew right away what was in the gift box. And I was really hoping for a clever ending not just an obvious conclusionAlso, it was sooo frustrating that the obvious solutions were ignored. Like uh, hey, maybe tie her up so she can't commit suicide? Kind of obvious. Do that for 2 weeks, maybe there's a time limit?The movie stole some of the plot from other movies. Notably Denzel-Washington's Fallen, with the ""I need to be alone, I'll go to a deserted cabin in the woods, to defeat this demon that possesses people"". I was waiting for her to start rolling a poison cigarette.What stinks is that it was pretty well written and acted, the visuals were really good.

"Yes it borrows from a few other horror films, yes it really isn't original, but it's well done and a fun watch. I try to enjoy a movie without expecting the Godfather every time, and this movie made it easy. The camera work is good, better than you see in allot of films, and the sound design might be a little heavy handed but very effective. The only time this movie really falters is trying to get deep at the wrong times, once you go down the path of making a popcorn flick trying to make you jump just go with it, the ship on self examination has pretty much already sailed.

"I was conflicted when I first saw this.It definitely creeped me out, which is really hard to do since I've watched every horror movie that looks halfway decent and hardly anything gets to me anymore.However, that being said, at times I could see how it might turn some people off with the smile thing. Luckily for this film I find evil smiles extremely creepy but at a couple points I really felt like ""damn, that looks silly"". And if you don't find unnatural smiles creepy than this movie will just be kinda stupid to you I imagine.But the biggest sin which is the real reason I remove 3 stars is that last scene. There is no excuse for that guy doing what he did.

"I'm a hard man to please. Horror has got a lot better recently, and I have to say that Smile is one of the better examples of a genre that is enjoying a purple patch. Whatever that is...Sosie Bacon puts in an engaging performance as Rose Cotter, haunted psychiatrist, trying to understand the nature of an entity that is tormenting her after she witnesses the suicide of one of her patients.There is borrowing afoot here, albeit mildly, from previous gems such as It Follows and the original Candyman. This is perhaps only when you squint hard enough, but the aerial shots and interesting flips and angles give a nice unsettling feeling that reminded me of the long tracking aerial views of the latter.Cinematography is on par here, as is direction. There are the jump scares you would expect from lesser horror flicks, but they are outweighed by the unsettling atmosphere and claustrophobic terror that is built throughout the second and third acts.This is a film that has done its homework and ensured all criteria are met ably. My only criticism would be towards a slightly formulaic third act that you can see coming from a mile away, but it still manages to rise above other genre pieces by being well executed. It is definitely a movie you will not regret watching if you are a fan of the genre, or if you want to introduce someone who prefers a horror where substance outweighs brutal gore-laden set pieces.",hard man please horror got lot better recently say smile one better example genre enjoying purple patch whatever sosie bacon put engaging performance rose cotter haunted psychiatrist trying understand nature entity tormenting witness suicide one patient borrowing afoot albeit mildly previous gem follows original candyman perhaps squint hard enough aerial shot interesting flip angle give nice unsettling feeling reminded long tracking aerial view latter cinematography par direction jump scare would expect lesser horror flick outweighed unsettling atmosphere claustrophobic terror built throughout second third act film done homework ensured criterion met ably criticism would towards slightly formulaic third act see coming mile away still manages rise genre piece well executed definitely movie regret watching fan genre want introduce someone prefers horror substance outweighs brutal gore laden set piece
"""If you smile into the abyss, the abyss smiles back at you."" As an experienced horror viewer, I must say it has been a while since I felt fear crawling in my skin at the movie theatre. This movie did just that, and even though some grotesque visual choices at some point felt like this near masterpiece tried to recreate scenes already seen in such films as The Ring and Hereditary, it globally stands out from the competition and delivers a truly unique experience. The first real jumpscare is truly brilliant, totally unexpected. The sound editing and music score are flawless, they borrow ideas from such great horror influence like Silent Hill 2 (2002) and the atmosphere is tense and unsettling. Edge of your seat movie? No. It's rather the opposite : you wish you could disappear behind your seat and stop watching. Despite being original and close to a hardcore feature (PG-17), some transitions were lame, some story points were hard to believe or mistakenly added (Rose's husband and sister are useless, the bearded patient at the hospital already knows from the start about the curse yet he is not harmed at all by the entity), but overall, if Smile can scare you while you're surrounded by two hundred people, just wait until you watch it all alone in your basement...and trust me, no smile will show up on your face in the end. ðŸ˜Š An end that brings to life what it really feels like when an evil crawls inside and never let go. True fear is not the fear of what's outside...but what's within! ðŸ˜ˆP. S. To those whining about ""not knowing where the evil entity comes from, what it wants and how to kill it""...I'd recommend you start playing horror videogames, you'll get your answers. Movies are always opened to multiple interpretations! ðŸ˜‰...as for the predictable ending...one of my all time favorite ""feel good horror flick"" that is at the same time disturbing yet funny throughout, Drag Me to Hell by Sam Raimi, the very ending scene is displayed on purpose on the cover art of the movie, yet every bit of insanity the character goes through is delightful, so it's the road you travel that matters, not the destination!",smile abyss abyss smile back experienced horror viewer must say since felt fear crawling skin movie theatre movie even though grotesque visual choice point felt like near masterpiece tried recreate scene already seen film ring hereditary globally stand competition delivers truly unique experience first real jumpscare truly brilliant totally unexpected sound editing music score flawless borrow idea great horror influence like silent hill atmosphere tense unsettling edge seat movie rather opposite wish could disappear behind seat stop watching despite original close hardcore feature pg transition lame story point hard believe mistakenly added rose husband sister useless bearded patient hospital already know start curse yet harmed entity overall smile scare surrounded two hundred people wait watch alone basement trust smile show face end end brings life really feel like evil crawl inside never let go true fear fear outside within p whining knowing evil entity come want kill recommend start playing horror videogames get answer movie always opened multiple interpretation predictable ending one time favorite feel good horror flick time disturbing yet funny throughout drag hell sam raimi ending scene displayed purpose cover art movie yet every bit insanity character go delightful road travel matter destination

I enjoyed watching the people on Googlebox watching it more than I've enjoyed watching this pile of poo!!It's one of those horror films that is only scary (ie makes you jump) because no one turns the Dan lights on!!

Pop a few lamps on and there is nothing to be scared of!I really want to post this review but need to type a further one hundred and sixty odd characters, despite the fact I do not really have anything further to say about the film.

"A not so subtle rip off of several movies before it. The ring, It Follows and many others just like them. A curse or entity passed on from young adult to young adult. Even the creepy smile is lifted from that horrible Truth or Dare movie. Uninspiring and relying heavily on jump scares. Much of the scene in the trailer tip you off to what's about to happen in the movie. However, the scares are there and it's well directed. Fantastic marketing and genuine scares have extremely overrated this film. But nonetheless, it is a fun watch.

"Smile is what a horror movie should be. Putting you on the edge of your seat, while fearing for what might happens next. It gives the audience a uneasy feeling for the majority of the film.

I like how this movie is metaphoric in a way and it's just so good. The ending has a good twist and those last moments of the movie where amazing in my opinion it surpassed my expectations.But (Spoiler Warning) The cat cgi was honestly really bad and there were like 2 moments that it felt off and made me laugh instead of being scared or creep out. But overall the movie is genuinely scary and the concept is executed brilliantly and it gives you the chills and Creeps and you probably will never want to see someone smiling at you again.",great horror movie genuinely scary shocking keep edge manages scare many surprising way evenunexpected way like movie metaphoric way good ending good twist last moment movie amazing opinion surpassed expectation spoiler warning cat cgi honestly really bad like moment felt made laugh instead scared creep overall movie genuinely scary concept executed brilliantly give chill creep probably never want see someone smiling
"Smile is good with its acting and story that it tells the audience that there might be something that is truly haunting Rose. Rose (Sosie Bacon) works at a hospital that she treats for unstable patients. She works for them to help themselves to get better, but until one day in her office, a young woman named Laura (Caitlin Stasey) commits suicide in front of her with a smile as you see in the trailers. After her death, there might be someone or something after the trauma that Rose has experienced that is coming after her. Rose is trying to find a solution for this that will end this nightmare forever. Overall, I had chills and goosebumps experiencing the creepy stuff that happens in this movie and it has a good ending. Smile even reminded me of Blumhouse's Truth or Dare back in 2018, but better! I would recommend the movie if you are trying to get your horror fix in.",smile good acting story tell audience might something truly haunting rose rose sosie bacon work hospital treat unstable patient work help get better one day office young woman named laura caitlin stasey commits suicide front smile see trailer death might someone something trauma rose experienced coming rose trying find solution end nightmare forever overall chill goosebump experiencing creepy stuff happens movie good ending smile even reminded blumhouse truth dare back better would recommend movie trying get horror fix
"The movie sounded and seemed interesting and promising, at first. Its pros were the atmospheric cinematography and the elaborate use of sound effects, as well as the script and the idea behind it. The script has followed the three-act structure in an obvious manner and rather faithfully. You can tell when each act starts and ends. Additionally, Sosie Bacon's outstanding performance keeps you awake throughout the movie, engaging you to the heroine's journey. An applause for that!In contrast to all these cinematographic achievements of the film, we have the collapse of the third act. Unfortunately, the film fails to fulfill its promise and while it highlights the effects of the trauma- the element at the core of the story- and creates an entire allegorical narrative of its nature, the conclusion seems too clichÃ©d and returns to the narrow-mindedness of the mainstream American horror genre.Too bad that such a clever idea, a ""manifesto"" regarding the demonization of smile and the haunting of the trauma of the person that endures it is destroyed by such a poor third act.",movie sounded seemed interesting promising first pro atmospheric cinematography elaborate use sound effect well script idea behind script followed three act structure obvious manner rather faithfully tell act start end additionally sosie bacon outstanding performance keep awake throughout movie engaging heroine journey applause contrast cinematographic achievement film collapse third act unfortunately film fails fulfill promise highlight effect trauma element core story creates entire allegorical narrative nature conclusion seems clich return narrow mindedness mainstream american horror genre bad clever idea manifesto regarding demonization smile haunting trauma person endures destroyed poor third act
This movie was awesome! The movie seemed like it could be one of those boring ones but i can assure you its not. The true horror fans will enjoy this one.

"I SOOO didn't want to see this because that darn smile Hollywood has been trying to make scary is actually silly and completely void of frights. The trailers I willingly saw confirmed my hatred for this new trope.And yet, despite my preconceived concerns, being hardly original with poor CGI and running too long, this was still pretty enjoyable. Probably mostly due to (is that Ally Sheedy's daughter?) Sosie Bacon's performance of a happy, help-driven MD slowly transitioning into madness. Also, it was well shot and had solid performances all around. And it helped the huge fake smiles were kept to a minimum, with the exception of the several annoying smiles pointed out from background objects.Dr. Not-Ally-Sheedy's Daughter is treating a mental patient when said patient vaguely advises what's wrong immediately before killing herself. Now the doc isn't feeling pretty sane, herself. I bet this'll follow her around for a short while.I gasped at the 1 hour 55 runtime when this began, but I will say it's paced well enough and the story does progress faster than expected. Sure, it could've been trimmed. Her drop in sanity is a little too gradual. I wouldn't necessarily want to see it again, but I absolutely enjoyed the time I did watch it.Just don't make the inevitable Smile Back. One and done, people. One and done.***Final Thoughts: The film this most reminded me of was It Follows. If you liked that, chances are this would be a great double feature for you. Only, I'd save the best for last and put Smile first.Also, coincidentally, lead actress, Sosie Bacon, was born on my 18th birthday. Not sure that's relevant, but pretty cool. It did happen to be my all-time most memorable birthday with me seeing my all-time favorite musical group, Roxette, live and also skydiving the one and only time in my life.And what was with that refrigerator?

"I was so excited to see this movie come to streaming on Amazon Prime. The trailer for this had been so promising. Boy that was about the only good parts of the movieThe beginning has a very large build up. An overworked psychiatrist (Rose) sees a lot of patients. Before heading home she sees one new client. The girl who starts all of this. The new patient grabs a porcelain vase while Rose is calling for help. She then has a huge smile on her face as she slits her own throat.From then on Rose is experiencing strange events and seems unhinged to those around her.Rose and what I assume is her ex boyfriend and cop (Joel) start searching for answers as he is the only one who will believe her.They find the one person who has been able to escape this cycle (think final destination). From that point on Rose's hallucinations get worse making her see people who are not there.This wasn't scary, horror, or even a thriller movie. For most of the movie it is sad that someone is suffering from mental illness and trying to cope from the trauma of their youth.Rose starts to see her mother at one point that turns into a ""demon"" of sorts. I guess this is the horror aspect.The actors did a great job with what they were given but that wasn't a lot. There were 3 of us watching Smile and I was the only one to stay awake through this extremely long movie. It ends as you would expect.",excited see movie come streaming amazon prime trailer promising boy good part moviethe beginning large build overworked psychiatrist rose see lot patient heading home see one new client girl start new patient grab porcelain vase rose calling help huge smile face slit throat rose experiencing strange event seems unhinged around rose assume ex boyfriend cop joel start searching answer one believe find one person able escape cycle think final destination point rose hallucination get worse making see people scary horror even thriller movie movie sad someone suffering mental illness trying cope trauma youth rose start see mother one point turn demon sort guess horror aspect actor great job given lot u watching smile one stay awake extremely long movie end would expect
"I watched this and I laughed more than getting scared, I laughed at cheesy bad moments.

This is a short boring review, I'm tired, at least it had a good idea and the actors did good but it just didn't do justice. 3/10 stars, generic horror movie that's not really scary but the idea was creative. Also half the theatre laughed at the reveal of the ""monster""

"I like this one - it's well acted (fine cast) and produced, the sound design adds some good flavor to the dark atmosphere. The slowly creeping in madness and some fine moments of psychological horror make Smile a suspenseful and entertaining dark ride. No doubt, the story does not invent the wheel new but delivers solid stuff with some creepy moments and some good old jump scares.

If you dig horror movies a la Hereditary, It Follows, The Ring, Ringu, The Badadook and so on, this one will deliver.

"I was not scared a single point during this movie.Any kind of build up to tension was completely lost on me. The story was so basic and very 90s horror without actually being scary. None of the jumpscares made me flinch and the only thing that was genuinely unsettling was the 5head of the creature at the end. The CGI was poorly done and half of the movie was in the dark. I feel no empathy towards the main character or her struggle. Half of the ""scary scenes"" were already in the trailer so you know everything that's going to happen. This movie was so overhyped, I saw all these people on tiktok saying it was so traumatizing and scary but I was laughing at all of the ""scary"" scenes.",scared single point movie kind build tension completely lost story basic horror without actually scary none jumpscares made flinch thing genuinely unsettling head creature end cgi poorly done half movie dark feel empathy towards main character struggle half scary scene already trailer know everything going happen movie overhyped saw people tiktok saying traumatizing scary laughing scary scene
"Smile is the type of movie made by directors/writers who aren't entirely untalented but are essentially jugglers and borrowers: the movie is a visual and narrative patch of previous movies,subgenres and tropes.It borrows mostly from Asian horror movies with a ""grudge"" trope, but also from It Follows, Conjuring-type movies and more peripherally from some Exorcist 3 set pieces.Is it good? It's the definition of barely watchable. Though it has several scares, it feels unoriginal and features some questionable stylistic choices: it has a rosy cinematography and the main character is called ""Rose"", so it comes across as a bit wink-wink nod-nod (also an on the nose reference to Aliens seems too crass). It overdoes the camera upside down shots, and some characters seem underwritten if not left behind. Kal Penn's acting is hammy and tonally confused.The fact that it merges 2 unrelated narratives (the mother and the smile, though imdb trivia points at a very tenuous connection) seems forced-- likewise the ending, first with a false ending than with what seems like a complete cop-out, let's finish this final scene.",smile type movie made director writer entirely untalented essentially juggler borrower movie visual narrative patch previous movie subgenres trope borrows mostly asian horror movie grudge trope also follows conjuring type movie peripherally exorcist set piece good definition barely watchable though several scare feel unoriginal feature questionable stylistic choice rosy cinematography main character called rose come across bit wink wink nod nod also nose reference alien seems crass overdoes camera upside shot character seem underwritten left behind kal penn acting hammy tonally confused fact merges unrelated narrative mother smile though imdb trivia point tenuous connection seems forced likewise ending first false ending seems like complete cop let finish final scene
The movie is stressful but not a typical horror movie. The horror is in the context. But the movie slows down in 2nd half with little surprises. The build up is excellent. The scares are like any other horror movie. The theme and basic story line is excellent. And lead characters have been built up rather well. But only few characters are well drawn out. The police guy could have been better etched.While you are at the edge of seat wondering how best van this end but you could predict the last scene with 1 hour to go. I think the story writing is lazy. Could have been much better. Sosie Bacon in lead role is really good. Overall worth one watch.,movie stressful typical horror movie horror context movie slows nd half little surprise build excellent scare like horror movie theme basic story line excellent lead character built rather well character well drawn police guy could better etched edge seat wondering best van end could predict last scene hour go think story writing lazy could much better sosie bacon lead role really good overall worth one watch
"Why did i look at myself in the mirror and start smiling The movie is very beautiful, there are scary and impressive scenes. It affects people deeply, the deaths were also very scary and impressive I really got goosebumps I was afraid in every scene, of course, the reason I gave a missing point was that there were some deficiencies in the movie, for example, I was waiting for the woman to be saved at the end, but she died And I was hoping she'd break up with her fiancÃ© and go back to her ex-cop boyfriend it would have made more sense because her parents and new boyfriend didn't believe her I was sad at the end but all I remember is smiles I got goosebumps every time I saw their smiles good movie congratulations.",look mirror start smiling movie beautiful scary impressive scene affect people deeply death also scary impressive really got goosebump afraid every scene course reason gave missing point deficiency movie example waiting woman saved end died hoping break fianc go back ex cop boyfriend would made sense parent new boyfriend believe sad end remember smile got goosebump every time saw smile good movie congratulation
"Let me first summarize without spoilers... this was one of the better horror movies I've seen until the end. It's a classic case of less is more, or so it should of been. In my opinion this movie went from a solid nine to a six just because of the use of CGI.Now the spoilers. This was a beautifully suspenseful movie with a fantastic story and better acting. It was unfortunately killed by over use of CGI and trying to do too much. This movie follows mental health and it could of been left with her mom tormenting her at the end. But the overuse of CGI with the monster totally changed the direction of the movie and just killed it.",let first summarize without spoiler one better horror movie seen end classic case le opinion movie went solid nine six use cgi spoiler beautifully suspenseful movie fantastic story better acting unfortunately killed use cgi trying much movie follows mental health could left mom tormenting end overuse cgi monster totally changed direction movie killed
"I watched the movie with a friend and we both agreed to watch a horror movie. At first i didnt wanted to watch Smile because i already knew what i would expect. And here we are, i was right. The movie was a total joke and rubbish, not even horror. The movie was supposed to be a thriller but in the end it was comedy. Of course this ""horror"" movie has the same sceptic as every other horror movie these days, the characters are off, avoiding the self-evidence and most of the scenes, if not, the whole movie is predictable. I don't know why this became a trend but for me its stupid & ridiculous. This movie was a joke, not even scary.

"This movie had the specimen of a blockbuster. But it's so unfortunate how it turned out!It's not 100% original concept. Somewhere around the middle I remembered The Ring passing the curse scheme. Yet it was recreated really well. The director did magnificent job in executing the jump scares and producing overall good cinematography. The ""smile"" is awesomely awful!What sells it short? Many things, any of them is enough to ruin the experience. Acting is generally unconvincing, mostly bad. I was absolutely turned off by the prisoner's panic performance. The ending is so predictable. You could see it miles away. But the worst part IMO is that there's almost no backstory to color what is happening. What is that creature? Why is it doing this? Where did it come from? How did it all start? Why does it follow that sequence? Too many questions that answering in a satisfying way could have taken this movie to a masterpiece levelThe ending scene is simply a mess. The creature burns, then just like that it is back to invade its victim. The back to ex scent seems just like a twist for the sake of it, but doesn't flow smoothlyAlso, characters are inconsistent and their development is rushed.Overall, the movie lacks coherence and substantiation. You'll watch a bunch of well executed jump scares that do not tie upShame, I had such high hopes for it.

"But mostly it follows plot wise. I can't believe the writers of it follows haven't sued the writers of this movie yet for copy pasting the script.The story revolves around a psychologist who unpassionately spills out platitudes and never gets tired. She's an irresolute psychologist who suddenly turns all religious when in fact she should be looking into science/psychology for an explanation. She goes to therapy and self diagnose herself in front of her therapist and conveys with her body language that she thinks of her therapist as someone stupid. Her finance is a weakling. Her sister bails on her. Her ex is a good guy but the protagonists bails on him and that's why he's an ex but she chooses to be with a weakling guy/her finance who's into toxic positivity.

"In a year with few and far between pleasent stories arising out of the current state of the global box office performance of cinematic releases, one of the genuinely surprising results stems from Parker Finn's feature length debut Smile.An extenuation of his short film Laura Hasn't Slept, Finn's film was originally planned to be a direct to streaming affair that at the last minute was given a shot at a cinematic run by its studio Paramount who look like geniuses with Smile grossing more than $200 million worldwide against a miniscule budget of $17 million with Finn's film not only earning interest from audiences but also critics who were taken aback by a genre film that for all intents and purposes seemed like nothing more than a cheap cash grab reaching for low hanging fruit.Taking a relatively familiar set-up but exploring it in a way that offers both some excitment and thrills/chills while filming it in a way that feels slightly above what you would expect from such a jaunt (hats off to cinematographer Charlie Sarroff), Finn draws a lot from the simple set-up of Sosie Bacon's kindly pychiatrist Rose Cotter dealing with the aftermath of a grissly patient suicide that has thrown her life into chaos and dispear when it appears that an entity behind the patients death has latched itself onto Rose as she battles to maintain her sanity and her relationships, that includes her worried boyfriend A-Train (aka Jessie T. Usher).On paper there's no reason why this plotline or idea should be more than a mildly amusing venture at best but thanks to Finns energetic direction, committed lead turn from Bacon in her best role yet and affective and unnerving horror elements (perhaps fans of felines should steer clear from the film), Smile keeps us engaged throughout as Rose begins to understand more about what is unraveling her life why we the audience wonder if we will ever look at someone smiling in the same way again.At days end there is nothing groundbreaking about Smile or the ground it covers but if nothing else Finn's strong debut once more showcases what can be done with a minminal budget, some enthuisiasm and strong understanding of the genre one works in with Smile proving that amongst all the doom and gloom audiences are willing to support movies that offer up what they promise and that cinema is alive when the right material is there to support.Final Say -Another nice horror story from 2022, Smile offers up one of the years most surprisingly effective outings that breaks no new ground but provides the exact type of experience many will be wanting from a chilling outing that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout.3 1/2 terrible birthday presents out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",year far pleasent story arising current state global box office performance cinematic release one genuinely surprising result stem parker finn feature length debut smile extenuation short film laura slept finn film originally planned direct streaming affair last minute given shot cinematic run studio paramount look like genius smile grossing million worldwide miniscule budget million finn film earning interest audience also critic taken aback genre film intent purpose seemed like nothing cheap cash grab reaching low hanging fruit taking relatively familiar set exploring way offer excitment thrill chill filming way feel slightly would expect jaunt hat cinematographer charlie sarroff finn draw lot simple set sosie bacon kindly pychiatrist rose cotter dealing aftermath grissly patient suicide thrown life chaos dispear appears entity behind patient death latched onto rose battle maintain sanity relationship includes worried boyfriend train aka jessie usher paper reason plotline idea mildly amusing venture best thanks finn energetic direction committed lead turn bacon best role yet affective unnerving horror element perhaps fan feline steer clear film smile keep u engaged throughout rose begin understand unraveling life audience wonder ever look someone smiling way day end nothing groundbreaking smile ground cover nothing else finn strong debut showcase done minminal budget enthuisiasm strong understanding genre one work smile proving amongst doom gloom audience willing support movie offer promise cinema alive right material support final say another nice horror story smile offer one year surprisingly effective outing break new ground provides exact type experience many wanting chilling outing edge seat throughout terrible birthday present jordan eddie movie guy
"It's like ""It Follows"" and ""Fallen"" had a baby and here it is. Pretty good though. Predictable jump scares, but creepy throughout. Not many likable characters at all. I was watching and hoping for sure the sister would be unalived as soon as she spoke her first words. Very smug and annoying. Her husband wasn't any better. A very somber movie that you couldn't really look away from or you might miss something important. A little bit confusing at times, but I guess that was just the roller coaster of her mind. Definitely left the door WIDE open for a sequel...which I would eagerly watch.

"Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a psychiatrist with the emergency psychiatric unit who carries the trauma of witnessing her mother's suicide as a child. When a disturbed young woman, Laura Weaver (Cailtin Stasey) is brought into the hospital telling Rose that she's being haunted by some sort of force or entity that takes the form of people she knows or random strangers characterized by a malevolent smile, Rose believes it to be signs of delusions brought about by trauma but Laura begins exhibiting violent panic before entering a trance like state where she commits suicide while grinning ear to ear. Laura's death rests uneasily with Rose and soon she too begins seeing visions of malevolent smiling characters as her life comes unraveling around her and the entity may be real.Smile is the feature length debut of Parker Finn and is an adaptation of Finn's short film Laura Hasn't Slept which features Stasey in the lead a role which she briefly reprises in this film. Paramount tapped Finn to adapt his short for a feature with the original intention being to release it as an original for the Paramount+ subscription streaming service but following high test screenings it was opted to release the film theatrically. The film became a sleeper hit upon its release in late September overperforming past its expectations and earning $216 million against its $17 million budget. Critical and audience reception was also very strong with many praising the film's atmosphere, performances, and direction. Smile is made from familiar parts, but it puts those familiar parts to good use with a clever and unnerving execution.Sosie Bacon is absolutely fantastic in the lead role of Rose who is still dealing with the trauma of her mother's suicide and has tried to move past it by helping others as a psychiatrist. Despite her commitment to her profession you see that she herself is not fully healed from the trauma which still colors her outlook to a degree and has caused a rift with her sister who has dealt with their troubled childhood by diving into a superficial surface level existence that has a similar trauma masked behind the bright exuberance she projects. There's a strong theme of trauma hidden behind smiles and the movie reinforces that motif with scenes lingering on the fake smiles put on posters or advertisements throughout the film which is intermixed with episodes wherein the entity manifests itself in vivid hallucinations characterized by the predatory sneer that adorns the faces of those in Rose's life. There are some absolutely unnerving scenes in this film and there's seldom a moment's peace because of how our protagonist's perspective is unreliable so any episode could be around the next corner. The biggest issue for me with smile was not in its familiarity to other films such as The Ring or It Follows as some have pointed out, but more in the route it takes in the third act. As with many horror films I feel Smile maybe tries to leave its audience with a final shock at the expense of the subtext of its film regarding mental health and trauma and the way in which Smile does this has the unintended effect of making a fatalistic statement on trauma and while I'm not averse to the idea of the evil possibly having an opportunity to return, I probably would've preferred something with more ambiguity as with the ending to It Follows.Smile features strong work from both Parker Finn and Sosie Bacon and is effectively disturbing and unnerving in its execution. While made from familiar parts it puts them to good use and makes something atmospheric and unsettling. The third act does have issues I feel undermine Smile's strengths but overall this is a solid horror film.",dr rose cotter sosie bacon psychiatrist emergency psychiatric unit carry trauma witnessing mother suicide child disturbed young woman laura weaver cailtin stasey brought hospital telling rose haunted sort force entity take form people know random stranger characterized malevolent smile rose belief sign delusion brought trauma laura begin exhibiting violent panic entering trance like state commits suicide grinning ear ear laura death rest uneasily rose soon begin seeing vision malevolent smiling character life come unraveling around entity may real smile feature length debut parker finn adaptation finn short film laura slept feature stasey lead role briefly reprises film paramount tapped finn adapt short feature original intention release original paramount subscription streaming service following high test screening opted release film theatrically film became sleeper hit upon release late september overperforming past expectation earning million million budget critical audience reception also strong many praising film atmosphere performance direction smile made familiar part put familiar part good use clever unnerving execution sosie bacon absolutely fantastic lead role rose still dealing trauma mother suicide tried move past helping others psychiatrist despite commitment profession see fully healed trauma still color outlook degree caused rift sister dealt troubled childhood diving superficial surface level existence similar trauma masked behind bright exuberance project strong theme trauma hidden behind smile movie reinforces motif scene lingering fake smile put poster advertisement throughout film intermixed episode wherein entity manifest vivid hallucination characterized predatory sneer adorns face rose life absolutely unnerving scene film seldom moment peace protagonist perspective unreliable episode could around next corner biggest issue smile familiarity film ring follows pointed route take third act many horror film feel smile maybe try leave audience final shock expense subtext film regarding mental health trauma way smile unintended effect making fatalistic statement trauma averse idea evil possibly opportunity return probably would preferred something ambiguity ending follows smile feature strong work parker finn sosie bacon effectively disturbing unnerving execution made familiar part put good use make something atmospheric unsettling third act issue feel undermine smile strength overall solid horror film

"This movie is okay. I didn't find it particularly scary though the sound design added a degree of unease. There's some good cinematography and some interesting drone camera shots.Overall the premise seems a little well trodden and the instantly disbelieving side characters are a little cliche.Sosie Bacon is very good and her performance is easily the highlight. The film asks some interesting questions about grief and trauma but I don't think delves too deep into having a message or meaning.It'll draw comparisons with the far superior ""it follows"" and there are one or two nice moments. The birthday party was my favourite scene. Unfortunately the climax let me down and I found it predictable.It's certainly not the worst horror I've seen this year and I enjoyed it on balance.",movie okay find particularly scary though sound design added degree unease good cinematography interesting drone camera shot overall premise seems little well trodden instantly disbelieving side character little cliche sosie bacon good performance easily highlight film asks interesting question grief trauma think delf deep message meaning draw comparison far superior follows one two nice moment birthday party favourite scene unfortunately climax let found predictable certainly worst horror seen year enjoyed balance
"Okay so I watched this one right after I got done watching Nope, by Jordan Peele, and I have to mention that after watching a directionless movie like NOPE, this movie was even more disappointing.A mind altering creature / spirit/ entity that somehow invades your mind and affects....... YOU. And you alone. Until it moves on.It just didn't impress me at all. I did like seeing Kal Penn and Jane from Deadwood in here but really the story was blah. Some interesting effects but really nothing original to see here. 3/10And IMDB has now made it so a review has to have 600 characters before it can be entered. I really don't expect that to last very long because people are sure to complain about it. But until that happens I guess we have to expect reviews to be long winded and sometimes about absolutely nothing to do with the show in question.",okay watched one right got done watching nope jordan peele mention watching directionless movie like nope movie even disappointing mind altering creature spirit entity somehow invades mind affect alone move impress like seeing kal penn jane deadwood really story blah interesting effect really nothing original see imdb made review character entered really expect last long people sure complain happens guess expect review long winded sometimes absolutely nothing show question
"No cheap jump scares here, folks. They serve one of two purposes. If they don't immediately lift you out if your allocated seat then they're designed to slowly, positively ratchet up the tension.This isn't a cheap B-grade horror, either (NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT!). The special effects are frighteningly good - whether subtle or in yo face.I bet you $100 that there's an argument in psychotherapy & psychiatry circles* that goes along the lines of, ""we must be careful when treating trauma that we don't induce further trauma.""

"I watched Smile thinking Barbarian was the best horror of the year. By the end I had a smile on my face bigger than the Big Bad's!

Before that was Ringu. Smile is definitely up there.They are none of them fast-moving but honestly the quiet passages are where the atmosphere builds. The birthday scene is a great example: I knew what was coming and I was literally yelling at the screen.There is gore, but it punctuates the film rather than becoming the point of it. There are also jump scares.

"It's a compelling and effective horror that tells the same old tale in a very refreshing way. The idea that has been portrayed a million times before in various ways manages to feel authentic and makes quite an impression. Main character's performance is excellent and really makes the movie believable. It relies more on actual psychological trauma than the curse and showcases genuine fears about mental illness. It has a fair amount of clichÃ©s that follow a generic form and are expected to deliver a predictable ending, but the tables turn and the ending turns out to be very simple, but also makes the whole experience worthwhile.",compelling effective horror tell old tale refreshing way idea portrayed million time various way manages feel authentic make quite impression main character performance excellent really make movie believable relies actual psychological trauma curse showcase genuine fear mental illness fair amount clich follow generic form expected deliver predictable ending table turn ending turn simple also make whole experience worthwhile
"""Smile"" is not an innovation effort. Deaths in chain due to a supernatural entity normally would mean boredom. But, it achieved a cool atmosphere and a glimpse of doubt. These days, that's almost remarcable.Sosie Bacon turned out to be a great choice for the job, and leads the movie the hole time. The rest of the cast stayed a bit behind (except
Robin Weigert).Parker Finn also granted a good debut, directing an intense movie, showing that he could be trusted with more ambitious projects.It's true this is not a very remarcable film, but i think it's enjoyable in the horror scene.

"I have finally come round to just accepting these movies for what they are. They are not going to be creditable horror, they are going to be laughable cheese-fests that will be fun to watch and make fun of and if I was wrong about them...great.This movie was too obnoxious to even watch in one sitting.I could go on and on about why it is goofy, derivative and lazy. I genuinely wanted to just go along with it and I got some malicious pleasure about watching it critically but over all I mainly annoyed.An ambitious approach cinematographically where the camera takes some unusual angles was handled better than Midsomar did it but that is a low bar if you ask me.The whole smiling gimmick was played out at least 20 years ago. Maybe if they were covering their mouths but I don't know. The thing feels written around this moronic image that Truth or Dare had already done recently but the crux of it is a story ominous patterns.The essence of this is very similar to The Ring. No shame in that. The two movies are about similar quality for me. It's the most engaging aspect of the movie really; something unusual is going on so just research the other victims and things do not look auspicious. There's a genuine plot in here, not too original but the success is always in the handling. Unfortunately the handling was never very good in the first place.Yet again, this feels like two different movies slammed together. I dig the gremlin-on-the-plan approach, I really do. Protagonist sees what others cannot and looks crazy though they aren't. It just doesn't really fit in here. The element of strange visions are cheap and as bad as a dream sequence. It's all more about spooky imagery that they never commit to than an actually eerie experience.The Julia Roberts under-study in the lead role...like Dani in Midsomar, I respect there's only so much you can do with an unengaging character. But her not-so-gradual descent into what may or may not be insanity was simpering and welpish. Her back story adds nothing and it all just feels like filler. She's a psychiatrist because it makes sense from a narrative standpoint: she is close contact with many people who (at least appear to be) suffering from delusions but the attempt by the film to be about confronting personal demons was over-ambitious and flaccidly realized.Kumar from Harold and Kumar is in it. It's a little illusion breaking but he is impeccable and good for him for breaking out of comic roles.And this might be the shallowest criticism I have ever made in a review but the lead actor's mole...it was distracting. I feel like a prick for bringing it up but it was one of the things I really remembered. I criticism of Alice Vikander as Lara Croft and the *couple of things* she was missing...I maintain that was more pertinent.If you genuinely horror with the halloween ghost house vibe and evoke more laughs than chills, maybe this is for you. If you've never seen a horror movie before, maybe this will affect you.

"Are we still saying 'committed' suicide in 2022? Especially in a film all about trauma and mental illness and...suicidal themes?? It perpetuates the shame of when suicide was a crime. I can't believe this was so normalised here of all places. Also, what's the overall message? That trauma is insurmountable and insidious and it's hopeless to try and overcome it? Bloody hell, that's depressing at the very least.Ok, I had to get that out before I drill down to why I give it a 4.Did it make me jump? Yes, at least a few times, which is saying something. However, was it worth the thrills against the obvious, the cliches, the cringeworthy and the unrealistic (and super fast) decline of the main character? In my opinion, nope. The main character has about 80% screen time and oh my god is she annoying! I very quickly wanted her to give up and get killed off. The behaviour of SO many of the characters was laughable for the wrong reasons and given that it takes itself so seriously, the irony of the title wasn't lost on me. Swing and a huge miss in my opinion. What a wasted opportunity and potentially hugely damaging to those struggling with mental illness.",still saying committed suicide especially film trauma mental illness suicidal theme perpetuates shame suicide crime believe normalised place also overall message trauma insurmountable insidious hopeless try overcome bloody hell depressing least ok get drill give make jump yes least time saying something however worth thrill obvious cliche cringeworthy unrealistic super fast decline main character opinion nope main character screen time oh god annoying quickly wanted give get killed behaviour many character laughable wrong reason given take seriously irony title lost swing huge miss opinion wasted opportunity potentially hugely damaging struggling mental illness
"I should have known better, but I gave this movie a chance.As all new mainstream horrors of the last two decades, it failed to deliver.Good things first: it's technically well made, camerawork is mostly good.The opening scene delivers a good setup.Acting is okay.Now the bad things and some spoilers:The main character is unlikeable and behaves contrary to everything she should know due to her profession as a therapist.Who if not her should know that if you try to convince your friends and family that something weird is happening but you're not hallucinating you should not behave like you're psychotic.This was simply the worst writing mistake I've seen in a long time.In nearly every scene where she tries to convince someone she's discovering a very bad secret, she acts batshit crazy and starts yelling I AM NOT CRAZY within 5 minutes of conversation. Even a very scared person should be able to act and talk different if that's her profession.Besides that, there are the usual cheap jumpscares for the mainstream audience, a plot that has been mostly copied from Ring and It Follows, a bad cgi-monster und the totally ruined ending.Save yourself some time and don't see this movie except you're exactly into jumpscares.

"This has been compared to 'It Follows'; while I didn't enjoy that, I had a great time with this. The nature of the evil being passed from person to person is much more solid here and smacks less of the superficial titillation the earlier film is guilty of. If it reminds me of anything, it would be 'The Ring'.Plenty of frightening moments and jump scares enliven a fairly slow-burning story that could easily have fallen into a pattern of repetition. Director Parker Finn accomplishes this with imagination, and a true sense of unease, helped enormously by Cristobal Tapia De Veer's kaleidoscopically manic soundtrack.As the threat becomes more tangible, the ghost of CGI threatens to cartoon-ify some climactic scenes, but they are subtly used and so much more effective for it. While the story uses many set pieces that have been done before, the acting is strong enough to keep it entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised by 'Smile', and am glad it appears to have become 2022's Halloween 'hit.' My score is 8 out of 10.",compared follows enjoy great time nature evil passed person person much solid smack le superficial titillation earlier film guilty reminds anything would ring plenty frightening moment jump scare enliven fairly slow burning story could easily fallen pattern repetition director parker finn accomplishes imagination true sense unease helped enormously cristobal tapia de veer kaleidoscopically manic soundtrack threat becomes tangible ghost cgi threatens cartoon ify climactic scene subtly used much effective story us many set piece done acting strong enough keep entertaining pleasantly surprised smile glad appears become halloween hit score

"The fact that so many people enjoyed this movie is terribly disappointing as the film lacks a cohesive story and relies on cheap jump scares to barely earn its horror category. The special effects look expensive but come across as cheap , the sound /
music ineffective , the acting is miserable and the cinematography far too spacious for the horror
genre. I would like to see some of my fellow horror aficionados that loathed this movie create something to save horror from devolving into drivel such as I witnessed while watching this film. The one saving grace is that I must say though is that I felt the marketing was extremely clever and for that reason it drew me to the film.Bottom line: Do not see this movie !",fact many people enjoyed movie terribly disappointing film lack cohesive story relies cheap jump scare barely earn horror category special effect look expensive come across cheap sound music ineffective acting miserable cinematography far spacious horror genre would like see fellow horror aficionado loathed movie create something save horror devolving drivel witnessed watching film one saving grace must say though felt marketing extremely clever reason drew film bottom line see movie
"When I saw the trailer, I thought it looked pretty creepy but I still expected it to be a cheap horror flick I'd never watch. But I kept seeing reviews saying this movie was way better than expected so I checked it out and... it was way better than I expected it to be. I thought it would be like Truth or Dare, but it was more like It Follows + The Ring.Any character that mentally unravels over the course of a movie can't be easy to play and Sosie Bacon acted the hell out of the role. If Toni Collette couldn't get awards recognition for Hereditary, I highly doubt Sosie would for this but she was that good.Another critique I've read was that the story is a bit predictable, but I think the movie was trying to go for dread over surprise.The CGI stuff during the climax took me out a little but the movie shined when it didn't rely on heavy visual FX... IDK if they used VFX to distort people's faces/smiles but if so, it was tastefully subtle, or maybe it was in the performances. Either way, it brought us into the uncanny valley.Overall it was unsettling, entertaining and very decent.",saw trailer thought looked pretty creepy still expected cheap horror flick never watch kept seeing review saying movie way better expected checked way better expected thought would like truth dare like follows ring character mentally unravels course movie easy play sosie bacon acted hell role toni collette get award recognition hereditary highly doubt sosie would good another critique read story bit predictable think movie trying go dread surprise cgi stuff climax took little movie shined rely heavy visual fx idk used vfx distort people face smile tastefully subtle maybe performance either way brought u uncanny valley overall unsettling entertaining decent
"Honestly, the ending was so predictable This movie was very predictable. As a whore fan lover, I knew that the ending had two ways to go. The two options: option 1) she dies and passes it on. Option 2) she kill somebody and still passes it on. I had predicted the ending before I even finished watching the movie. Disappointed! Good jump scenes, and some good scare scenes.

The idea was a good one but the story and execution was terrible. The plot doesn't dig deep enough into what or how this is happening. It just goes from one person to another without any real feelings of a threat happening. Other movies in this type of genre were better and more scary. As far as scary goes it is a 2 out of 10. Jumpscares do not equal scary. Movies need to stop using them for easy jumps.The trailer for this much did a much better job of the actual movie itself and dragged on with nothing really being solved. Main character didn't do much but suffer and get paranoid without acuallu trying to figure out how to deal with the whole thing.,idea good one story execution terrible plot dig deep enough happening go one person another without real feeling threat happening movie type genre better scary far scary go jumpscares equal scary movie need stop using easy jump trailer much much better job actual movie dragged nothing really solved main character much suffer get paranoid without acuallu trying figure deal whole thing
"It's fine if you're looking for a casual horror movie with a lot of jump scares and a simple premise. If that sounds amusing to you I'm sure you will enjoy this film. If you're someone like me who enjoys slow burns, very few jump scares and expansive stories I would really pass on this film.Even though this isn't the type of horror I love, I can still enjoy it if it's different. Unfortunately this movie is a copy and paste of other films, where our protagonist is ''cursed'' and they need to know how to get rid of it in a certain amount of time. I was able to predict almost everything and got scared zero times.To summarize, it's nothing new or noteworthy but a good film for casual viewers. I saw it with a friend and it was fun to hear people getting scared in the audience. I would never watch a movie like this by myself though, it does what it has to do but nothing else....",fine looking casual horror movie lot jump scare simple premise sound amusing sure enjoy film someone like enjoys slow burn jump scare expansive story would really pas film even though type horror love still enjoy different unfortunately movie copy paste film protagonist cursed need know get rid certain amount time able predict almost everything got scared zero time summarize nothing new noteworthy good film casual viewer saw friend fun hear people getting scared audience would never watch movie like though nothing else
"Smile features a genuinely unsettling first hour, with some fantastically crafted jumpscares enhanced by the deft sound design. The use of score and silence is especially unnerving, and you'll be jumping out of your seat on at least a couple of occasions. Parker Finn's visual style is also worthy of note, creating a sinister ambiance around Rose (a superb Sosie Bacon), with terrifying transitions. Caitlin Stasey's iconic smile creeps you out in unexpected ways during the first act, and every time she made an appearance, it actually made my hair stand on end. But the film loses a fair bit of steam in its second hour, with scares getting super predictable and even repetitive (the telephone scare is one such!).There's also a very thinly sketched trauma angle that's used as a means to add to Rose's worries. It clearly doesn't work to anticipated extents, coming off as an explanatory excuse than a solidly written arc. Rose feeling cut off from the rest of the world and fighting mental & supernatural battles herself was always going to be the film's route, although I liked Joel's (Kyle Gallner) interventions from time to time. Once the central premise become clear, it seemed not too different from It Follows and The Ring and this also overturned some of the effective build-up in the first hour.Also, I'm of the opinion that Smile would have been better at 95 minutes at most. The extra 20 minutes makes the film less impactful, and even though the extended climax is neatly staged (barring a little CGI), it doesn't leave you with the same ominous feeling. Finn could have done away with the allergorical depiction of trauma and focused on something less explored (like, why is the curse-transferring medium a smile?). Trauma-affected-protagonist fatigue could be one of the reasons, perhaps?",smile feature genuinely unsettling first hour fantastically crafted jumpscares enhanced deft sound design use score silence especially unnerving jumping seat least couple occasion parker finn visual style also worthy note creating sinister ambiance around rose superb sosie bacon terrifying transition caitlin stasey iconic smile creep unexpected way first act every time made appearance actually made hair stand end film loses fair bit steam second hour scare getting super predictable even repetitive telephone scare one also thinly sketched trauma angle used mean add rose worry clearly work anticipated extent coming explanatory excuse solidly written arc rose feeling cut rest world fighting mental supernatural battle always going film route although liked joel kyle gallner intervention time time central premise become clear seemed different follows ring also overturned effective build first hour also opinion smile would better minute extra minute make film le impactful even though extended climax neatly staged barring little cgi leave ominous feeling finn could done away allergorical depiction trauma focused something le explored like curse transferring medium smile trauma affected protagonist fatigue could one reason perhaps
"Well... it's a decent movie for sure. I watched this film because many people were saying that it's super scary and they had nightmares afterwards etc. Maybe for a 10 year old kid it is super scary but for an adult not really, it's not. To these people i have to say ''Is this your first horror movie?'' It's very atmospheric and the story is interesting, a solid concept idea but I wouldn't call this movie ''thrilling'', it has some intense scenes though. The performances were good, especially the acting of the female protagonist. She is really convincing about the whole being cursed/going insane situation but I think that the plot is nonsense. If you pay attention it's pretty clear that you can't beat this curse so what's the point of the whole movie when there is literally no hope for our characters? That makes the whole experience and the ending also a letdown for me.We don't really get information about how this cycle of death started, about its true origin, who is responsible for this curse, is it a witch? A demon? Satan himself? Is it Thanos? And I was really interested in knowing that. We only get to see that there are many victims one dying after the other after witnessing a gruesome event. The movie has a ''face your trauma/past'' theme which is a nice idea for a horror film. Based on the ending it seems like our protagonist wasn't able to deal with her trauma, she failed. Most of the characters I didn't really care about because they weren't developed enough. The only character that has some decent development is Rose.Im not the kind of guy who wants all movies to have a happy ending but in this movie like I mentioned before there is no chance to have a happy ending, the protagonist is doomed right from the start which sucks. This movie will keep you watching till the end because you start caring about the protagonist and you want to know what will happen next so the good thing is that the movie is definitely not boring. Sometimes it's slow but it's entertaining overall. The movie has some intense scenes and some interesting CGI which is a plus.Is this movie ground breaking? No

"I guess I'm too picky, I liked the movie, but, I wasn't terribly on edge, like the movie, A Quiet Place, or scared like The Shining or so many other great horror films. For some reason most of the jump scares didn't make me jump, and I didn't feel pulled in because there was no great character development or deeper understanding of the whole plot. But, I did enjoy the ride, kind of like when watching the remake of the movie IT, it had the creepy elements and good visuals and sound, yet it lacked originality because you know what's going to happen. Overall, it's definitely worth seeing, and you might really get into it, especially if you haven't seen the masterpieces to compare and you scare easily.",guess picky liked movie terribly edge like movie quiet place scared like shining many great horror film reason jump scare make jump feel pulled great character development deeper understanding whole plot enjoy ride kind like watching remake movie creepy element good visuals sound yet lacked originality know going happen overall definitely worth seeing might really get especially seen masterpiece compare scare easily
"If you think that Ari Aster blew a new spirit in horror genre then you need to think again. This one was more sinister and darker than Hereditary.The premise and the structure of the plot are quite familiar. A woman (psychiatrist) who is supposed to help others is compelled to answer the questions for her own past. When her relationship with her boyfriend/fiancÃ© and family goes awry she must embark on a journey to find the root cause of evil that torments her. In some ways, it will remind of Verbinski's (though, not his technically) The Ring.Either way, the jump scares, it has many of those are well-placed across the plot. The psychological tension that it builds is worthwhile.Why did I compare it to Ari Aster's work? Because if you have seen any of the latter's work you'd know where many movies close the scene after a scary happening Ari wants you to observe what his character does afterwards. Same here with Parker Finns, he wants you to see his character humiliated, doing stupid things etc.All in all, a truly refreshing take on horror genre. There is a good reason Paramount Pictures distributed this one. A must watch for horror geeks.",think ari aster blew new spirit horror genre need think one sinister darker hereditary premise structure plot quite familiar woman psychiatrist supposed help others compelled answer question past relationship boyfriend fianc family go awry must embark journey find root cause evil torment way remind verbinski though technically ring either way jump scare many well placed across plot psychological tension build worthwhile compare ari aster work seen latter work know many movie close scene scary happening ari want observe character afterwards parker finn want see character humiliated stupid thing etc truly refreshing take horror genre good reason paramount picture distributed one must watch horror geek
"Highly derivative, but entertaining horror flick that's elevated by a solid lead performance from Sosie Bacon (daughter of Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick!). Following a long line of ""cursed object"" horror stories, going as far back as THE MONKEY'S PAW to more recent stories such as THE RING films and the one this movie most resembles, the far superior IT FOLLOWS, SMILE delivers some decent scares and some effectively creepy moments, although there is an over-reliance on jump scares early on in the film. Without spoiling the lore behind the film's story (Bacon's uncovering of the mystery is the most interesting part), the film builds slowly (possibly a little too slowly without enough scares), the film ramps up nicely by the end for a terrific ending that's better than anything earlier in the film. While SMILE is nowhere as smart or as scary as IT FOLLOWS, there is an interesting subtext about mental illness and the effects of trauma that do elevate it above most horror flicks, but again, it's Bacon's performance that makes the film better than it deserves, giving a performance that's strong enough to leave the viewer asking, is this really happening or is she losing her mind?",highly derivative entertaining horror flick elevated solid lead performance sosie bacon daughter kevin bacon kyra sedgwick following long line cursed object horror story going far back monkey paw recent story ring film one movie resembles far superior follows smile delivers decent scare effectively creepy moment although reliance jump scare early film without spoiling lore behind film story bacon uncovering mystery interesting part film build slowly possibly little slowly without enough scare film ramp nicely end terrific ending better anything earlier film smile nowhere smart scary follows interesting subtext mental illness effect trauma elevate horror flick bacon performance make film better deserves giving performance strong enough leave viewer asking really happening losing mind
"When I originally saw the trailer for this movie, I did not think it was going to be that great, but I was interested in it either way. After watching Smile (2022) I thought it was better than I thought it was going to be from the trailer.Sosie Bacon in this movie was excellent, you can get behind the character and the things she goes through throughout the movie. She shows the trauma and difficulties she had in her life in a believable way.The smiling in the movie can be funny but disturbingly creepy when they hold on to it in long camera shots. When the deaths happen, they are creepy when they are smiling when dying in front of the main character scaring her for life.The movie has a good musical score that can give you chills and make you nervous like the main character. There are jump scares that are effective because the movie would hold on to shots without any music and have it just in silence.I liked some of the ways this smiling entity works and when they show how it spreads it is creepy and disturbing. The movie will also have you on edge having you wait for something to happen; this made the movie unpredictable at times.When I got closer to the 3rd act, I did not know what was going to happen next. Smile (2022) was a surprise, being creepy and suspenseful making this an entertaining horror movie that will leave you creeped out by the end of the movie.",originally saw trailer movie think going great interested either way watching smile thought better thought going trailer sosie bacon movie excellent get behind character thing go throughout movie show trauma difficulty life believable way smiling movie funny disturbingly creepy hold long camera shot death happen creepy smiling dying front main character scaring life movie good musical score give chill make nervous like main character jump scare effective movie would hold shot without music silence liked way smiling entity work show spread creepy disturbing movie also edge wait something happen made movie unpredictable time got closer rd act know going happen next smile surprise creepy suspenseful making entertaining horror movie leave creeped end movie

"Basic b-flat horror flick about an entity that needs its host to kill themself with a witness. The witness must be traumatized by the suicide and then the entity can invade that witness's body. It goes from one host to the next killing and traumatizing willy-nilly. Sounds scary, doesn't it? It should be scary because it doesn't offer much else. Unfortunately, except for the occasional scary smile, which thankfully the smile in question appears more than once and is indeed scary, as I say, except for that smile there isn't much meat here. There's too much reliance on hallucinations, after the fact we learn what we just saw was an hallucination, a cheap trick.

"This is one of the most poorly acted, poorly written movies I've ever seen. Every jump scare is a ringing phone or alarm.

"While watching this felt very much like It Follows. Well, sort of. It is better described as a version of It Follows that has developed schizophrenia.The whole film is rooted in mental trauma. Our main character is a therapist who has had her share of trauma. That trauma is compounded when she has a patient commit suicide in front of her while seemingly possessed by an unknown entity. Soon that entity is coming for her while her family and coworkers only see her behavior as delusional paranoia. Can she figure out what is going on?The entity is not explained well but it appears to be a demonic being that is passed from one soul to the next by way of the possessed committing suicide in front of the other. It then slowly infiltrates into that person's life by appearing as someone known to the individual and reveals itself with a sadistic smile. When it is not appearing in this manner, the individual is experiencing waking nightmares, extreme paranoia and hysteria which suggests to others that there is something mentally wrong them.The film is well made and well acted. It has several jump scares and tries to hold onto its tense atmosphere from beginning to end. The plot is interesting but vague at times. (I say this because I'd like to have seen how Mustache ended up where he did. If you've watched the film, you know what I'm talking about.) Overall, it wasn't a bad watch and I wouldn't mind suggesting it.",watching felt much like follows well sort better described version follows developed schizophrenia whole film rooted mental trauma main character therapist share trauma trauma compounded patient commit suicide front seemingly possessed unknown entity soon entity coming family coworkers see behavior delusional paranoia figure going entity explained well appears demonic passed one soul next way possessed committing suicide front slowly infiltrates person life appearing someone known individual reveals sadistic smile appearing manner individual experiencing waking nightmare extreme paranoia hysteria suggests others something mentally wrong film well made well acted several jump scare try hold onto tense atmosphere beginning end plot interesting vague time say like seen mustache ended watched film know talking overall bad watch mind suggesting

But then almost every scene ends with a jumpscare and that's stupid.It's a shame, I really wanted to like it, it's just... unlikeable.Overall setting is great, don't get me wrong; the whole story about the main character I can get as a metaphor for something (I don't want to get to the spoiler area), the main protagonist is doin' some kind of a job which is very related to that.There are great long shots, the beginning (I mean like the first 10--15 minutes) looks even very ""lynchian,"" I got so much Twin Peaks vibe from establishing shots, it's lovely!I thought it would be great up until that moment, but then there began those home scenes (fridge, window, doors, you know what...) and it was usually driven to a jumpscare or a false scare.I watched it for 20 more minutes and then I dropped it, it's unwatchable for me. I try it tomorrow again, maybe I'll change my rating (stars only).",greatly shot cinematics great tension present good really almost every scene end jumpscare stupid shame really wanted like unlikeable overall setting great get wrong whole story main character get metaphor something want get spoiler area main protagonist doin kind job related great long shot beginning mean like first minute look even lynchian got much twin peak vibe establishing shot lovely thought would great moment began home scene fridge window door know usually driven jumpscare false scare watched minute dropped unwatchable try tomorrow maybe change rating star
"I watched this based on reviews that stated Smile was scary. Where were the scares? I started falling asleep watching this boring film. So did my wife. The only scares came from the loud music blasting and her stupid phone constantly ringing. Maybe people were scared of a creepy smile. Well, that happened a couple of times so if that works for you, enjoy! A predictable plot with a very predictable ending. I had hoped there would be a decent scare or even a decent story. This film failed at both. I see more poor reviews coming in and wanted to add my two cents to help other viewers seeking horror.",watched based review stated smile scary scare started falling asleep watching boring film wife scare came loud music blasting stupid phone constantly ringing maybe people scared creepy smile well happened couple time work enjoy predictable plot predictable ending hoped would decent scare even decent story film failed see poor review coming wanted add two cent help viewer seeking horror
"One of the best horror suspense movies I have seen in a long time. Very well done, great acting, great script, great direction, great soundtrack, the ""greats"" just go on and on. (Warning! Spoilers follow!!)The movie reminds me of ""If Follows,"" a movie I loved despite its ""unhappy"" ending. I am not a fan of horror with unhappy endings. But once in a while, and unhappy ending is a pure definition of horror. Once in awhile I will forgive a story without a happily-ever-after-ending.And I will forgive the unhappy ending of this movie ~ which obviously sets up a sequel because we SEE why (brilliantly and terrifyingly) the people in the story kill themselves and why, as the main character states, the victims don't see to be themselves at that moment. Despite this, it does keep me personally from giving the movie a 9 or a10 ~ a good writer could have figured out how to have the hero save the day!Highly recommended. This filled me with dread and I had to watch videos like Hanson's ""MMMBop"" after watching it or I knew I would never sleep.

"None of this happened, Rose dreamed it all. Remember at the beginning of the movie where she leaves the office, and there is about 20 seconds of the camera being in the office.. alone. Its not plausible Rose heard the phone. This is when her nightmare begins.If you want to assume this happened. I will put my problems with the movie. Unsettling sound effects does not make a scary movie. Also, their is two opportunities of nudity. They should have had nudity there. The movie does give a unsettling feeling while watching it. The end credits music is very jarring. They have a happy song after all that has happened? Really??? Also, I don't think Rose is getting any sleep or very little.

"This movie probably plays a lot better to casual fans of horror, but, for more seasoned viewers, nothing here is original or done as well as the movie they're borrowing from. While Sosie Bacon's performance anchors the whole film, the poor writing sees it all go to waste and not have the same impact as, for example, Essie Davis' performance in The Babadook. The poor writing stands out the most as any subtly and nuance is obliterated by characters directly stating the movie's themes, which were fairly obvious from the opening scene.The film does have some solid jump scares and, at times, threatens to be tense and engaging, but huge sections feel like filler. It Follows does a much better job in creating a feeling that the monster is always after you and you can never relax, whereas Smile's creature shows up every now and again to remind us that this is a horror movie.And then there's the demon voice. Any chance that I may have found this movie scary evaporated when the creature spoke using the corniest, most generic vocal effects. My wife and I both burst out laughing the instant we heard the voice and that was that for taking the movie any sort of seriously.Smile is not necessarily a bad movie, but it fails to improve upon any of the ideas they borrow from other films and left me wishing I was watching one of them instead.",movie probably play lot better casual fan horror seasoned viewer nothing original done well movie borrowing sosie bacon performance anchor whole film poor writing see go waste impact example essie davis performance babadook poor writing stand subtly nuance obliterated character directly stating movie theme fairly obvious opening scene film solid jump scare time threatens tense engaging huge section feel like filler follows much better job creating feeling monster always never relax whereas smile creature show every remind u horror movie demon voice chance may found movie scary evaporated creature spoke using corniest generic vocal effect wife burst laughing instant heard voice taking movie sort seriously smile necessarily bad movie fails improve upon idea borrow film left wishing watching one instead
"Simple horror premises that take their ideas and find unique ways of making them feel original always impresses me. If for nothing else, I'll always commend a film for making something better than it has any right being. Smile is one of the latest films where I felt this way after viewing it. The promotional material for this movie made me laugh so I was worried that the genuine scares wouldn't work on me, but I was wrong. If you're a fan of the horror genre and are looking for a solid flick to check out before Halloween, Smile may be the one for you.Now playing in theatres, Smile follows Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) after having been through a disturbing interaction with a patient who was smiling at her during the interrogation. As the audience learns about her troubled past, Rose becomes a very interesting character as the film becomes much scarier. Yes, the gimmick of people smiling had me chuckling and it wasn't always scary, but the jump scares legitimately got me, which is rare. I can usually predict jump scares before they happen for most films, so the fact that this one had a few clever tricks surprised me. If for nothing else, Smile is a film that I will remember as one of the rare ones to make me jump in the theatre.The way this film reaches its climax and concludes was satisfying in terms of the story being told, but I'll also say that the climax of the film is the weakest aspect overall. For the first half, I was glued to the screen, either grinning at the odd visuals or genuinely being scared, but this film goes for it a little too much by the end. Like many mainstream horror releases, bigger doesn't always mean better. I enjoyed the over-the-top finale for what it was, but it just didn't feel like it was part of the same film. Nothing about it was bad by any means, but it definitely took me out of the film a couple of times. Aside from an identity crisis, this film works pretty well.Overall, I had no expectations going into this film, especially due to the fact that I was unsure if I would be able to take it seriously. With a very solid lead performance by Sosie Bacon and some very well-crafted horror moments by writer/director Parker Finn, I just simply had a good time with this one. I would also like to point out that Parker Finn has only ever directed a couple of short films in the past, so Smile marks his first feature film, and I must admit that's pretty impressive, especially given the end result. Smile doesn't break any new ground, but if you're a horror fan, I say check this one out.",simple horror premise take idea find unique way making feel original always impress nothing else always commend film making something better right smile one latest film felt way viewing promotional material movie made laugh worried genuine scare work wrong fan horror genre looking solid flick check halloween smile may one playing theatre smile follows rose cotter sosie bacon disturbing interaction patient smiling interrogation audience learns troubled past rose becomes interesting character film becomes much scarier yes gimmick people smiling chuckling always scary jump scare legitimately got rare usually predict jump scare happen film fact one clever trick surprised nothing else smile film remember one rare one make jump theatre way film reach climax concludes satisfying term story told also say climax film weakest aspect overall first half glued screen either grinning odd visuals genuinely scared film go little much end like many mainstream horror release bigger always mean better enjoyed top finale feel like part film nothing bad mean definitely took film couple time aside identity crisis film work pretty well overall expectation going film especially due fact unsure would able take seriously solid lead performance sosie bacon well crafted horror moment writer director parker finn simply good time one would also like point parker finn ever directed couple short film past smile mark first feature film must admit pretty impressive especially given end result smile break new ground horror fan say check one

"This film builds tension well during specific scenes and then overall with the plot. Unfortunately, the film seems too long with slow places, which may be relevant to showcase the psychological aspects, but the pacing doesn't keep itself steady overall for the tension to culminate more effectively. There is a disjointed feel to the film as the main character falls into her terror, which builds this tension and panic, only to dissipate when she tries to connect to others. The idea of intergenerational transmission of mental health issues or trauma is presented well. Sosie Bacon is excellent as the main character, starting her at a level of ""burnt out"" or trauma fatigue that can happen in the mental health field, and she maintains a grasp of sanity inside the delusional anxiety of the story line, where others question her assumption of the situation as psychosis rather than supernatural. The ending seems to want to build toward something that it is afraid to do, falling back into tropes of horror films and potential for sequels. A tighter script would have benefited the movie overall, and better exposition for characters would have build the world and thus improve the efforts to maintain tension. Worthy of a viewing, but not something that was overly exciting to me.",film build tension well specific scene overall plot unfortunately film seems long slow place may relevant showcase psychological aspect pacing keep steady overall tension culminate effectively disjointed feel film main character fall terror build tension panic dissipate try connect others idea intergenerational transmission mental health issue trauma presented well sosie bacon excellent main character starting level burnt trauma fatigue happen mental health field maintains grasp sanity inside delusional anxiety story line others question assumption situation psychosis rather supernatural ending seems want build toward something afraid falling back trope horror film potential sequel tighter script would benefited movie overall better exposition character would build world thus improve effort maintain tension worthy viewing something overly exciting
"'Smile' is the latest horror entry into 2022. Going into this movie I set my standards fairly low. With horror movies such as 'smile' being marketed solely on the concept which does have an unsettling connotation itself.Our protagonist is A psychiatric nurse who manages to have a demonic curse latch on to her through one of her patients. A curse that one can only consider as nightmare fuel. Our protagonist sees strange anomalies in her day to day life, mostly being strangers smiling at her in a foreboding manor.She soon learns that a demonic entity that has latched itself on to her and she only has certain amount of time before her inevitable demise. The entity that latched itself on to our protagonist slowly but surely destroys every part of her psyche.Sosie bacon who plays the lead role undoubtedly shows a truly terrifying performance on how this demon destroys her mentally, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.We see this haunting through the perspective of rose (sosie bacon) and also through her close friends and family. While relying heavily on jump scares. I would be lying if I said I wasn't thoroughly entertained throughout.The film has a certain ominous tone throughout, reminiscent of films such as 'the ring'. What helps this film really unsettle the viewer is the pacing throughout. It is a slow burn horror with a very ominous soundtrack that adds to the ambiance.One issue I have with this film however is that the film relies heavily on the soundtrack to unsettle the viewer. So much so that it becomes distracting in certain scenes.Smile' is nothing new and certainly nothing you haven't seen before but it does have a certain uncanny valley feel to it which I believe separates itself from other horrors.I had a good time with 'smile' and It will certainly be on my watchlist on halloween.",smile latest horror entry going movie set standard fairly low horror movie smile marketed solely concept unsettling connotation protagonist psychiatric nurse manages demonic curse latch one patient curse one consider nightmare fuel protagonist see strange anomaly day day life mostly stranger smiling foreboding manor soon learns demonic entity latched certain amount time inevitable demise entity latched protagonist slowly surely destroys every part psyche sosie bacon play lead role undoubtedly show truly terrifying performance demon destroys mentally blurring line fiction reality see haunting perspective rose sosie bacon also close friend family relying heavily jump scare would lying said thoroughly entertained throughout film certain ominous tone throughout reminiscent film ring help film really unsettle viewer pacing throughout slow burn horror ominous soundtrack add ambiance one issue film however film relies heavily soundtrack unsettle viewer much becomes distracting certain scene smile nothing new certainly nothing seen certain uncanny valley feel believe separate horror good time smile certainly watchlist halloween
"Probably one of if not the single worst horror film I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through.There are very, very few moments of genuine intrigue after the opening 10 minutes. Though if you're a fan of sudden loud noises being the only thing of interest in this dreadful display of cinema then feel free to spend your money and time on this.For those inclined to sit through and persevere after the initial smile there are only a handful of times you see it again, even when you do there is little explanation to what it is, where it comes from and what it wants. My assumption is this was left ambiguous for sequel bait.",probably one single worst horror film ever displeasure sitting moment genuine intrigue opening minute though fan sudden loud noise thing interest dreadful display cinema feel free spend money time inclined sit persevere initial smile handful time see even little explanation come want assumption left ambiguous sequel bait
"This is an absolute cinematic triumph. I can't endorse it highly enough. The musical score enhances the movie, but never detracts from the central focus of the scene. The acting was extremely skillfull. There is a terrific balance of likable and infuriating characters, but there's nuance in their depictions. The cinematography was extremely strong. Also, it was incredibly smart. I am an actual clinical social worker, and while the treatment protocol are dramatized for effect, the metaphor for what trauma does to a person is spot on. Also, it's genuinely the scariest movie I have seen in a good long while. A nice balance of larger atomospheric tension and fun jump scares. I can't say enough positive things about this movie.

"Hands down, this is horror done right. The horror genre is a hard one to master and we have seen Hollywood fail more oftentimes for producing not-so-good, or simply poor horror flops. This film is NOT one of them-it has all of the right elements to deliver such a creepy feeling, a disturbing sense, all while executing scares so well throughout. I had goosebumps from the minute the film started until it ended, so let me try to break it down without giving it away...It's 100% psychological from the perspective of the characters, obviously, but it is true horror within a horror that takes you through the spiral of a mental breakdown only to learn that the breakdown is REAL. An endless cycle on loop, if you will, for the ""chosen"".It attaches you from the inside out through the entire film with a surprising ending you wouldn't expect. You can feel the tension and moments of where the jump scares will come in but you don't know what they are exactly, and the music throughout is perfect to accompany those scary scenes so tastefully. If you're looking for creepy, this is it. If you're looking for jump scares, it's all there. If you're looking for a story that makes you want more, this will deliver in every way.I actually left the theater wanting to know more to the story, it's origins of how this came to be. There's possible hints in the film that may either allow for a prequel as well as a sequel, but regardless of what happens this film deserves every high rating. The producer(s), writers, directors, etc. Who all contributed to creating this film understood the assignment and delivered a solid horror film that viewers will love.Enjoy it.",hand horror done right horror genre hard one master seen hollywood fail oftentimes producing good simply poor horror flop film one right element deliver creepy feeling disturbing sense executing scare well throughout goosebump minute film started ended let try break without giving away psychological perspective character obviously true horror within horror take spiral mental breakdown learn breakdown real endless cycle loop chosen attache inside entire film surprising ending expect feel tension moment jump scare come know exactly music throughout perfect accompany scary scene tastefully looking creepy looking jump scare looking story make want deliver every way actually left theater wanting know story origin came possible hint film may either allow prequel well sequel regardless happens film deserves every high rating producer writer director etc contributed creating film understood assignment delivered solid horror film viewer love enjoy
"Ok, I normally don't review movies but as an extreme horror fan, I was compelled to after watching Smile. Honestly, I don't understand all these high ratings for such a generic horror with not really much originality. Maybe I have watched too much horror, but I was disappointed watching Smile as, based on so many high ratings, this movie was supposed to be the scariest most disturbing thing in recent history! Ok, the acting was pretty good for a horror, the premise was interesting, and the CGI scenes were alright. However, there is really no scary/disturbing parts except for the many, many, many jump scares. The saddest part is that if you have seen the trailer, you have already seen, what I would consider the most unique horror moment in this movie. I was creeped out by this scene the first time I saw the trailer and was really disappointed that no other scenes in the movie were comparable. Can't say it was a complete waste of time but I would say that it is not as great as people are making it out to be. It is a good watch but don't expect anything really original.",ok normally review movie extreme horror fan compelled watching smile honestly understand high rating generic horror really much originality maybe watched much horror disappointed watching smile based many high rating movie supposed scariest disturbing thing recent history ok acting pretty good horror premise interesting cgi scene alright however really scary disturbing part except many many many jump scare saddest part seen trailer already seen would consider unique horror moment movie creeped scene first time saw trailer really disappointed scene movie comparable say complete waste time would say great people making good watch expect anything really original

"""Smile"" is a psychological horror film written and directed by Parker Finn, based on his short film ""Laura Hasn't Slept"". Starring Sosie Bacon in the lead role, it is a surprisingly effective horror experience that rises above most of the usual genre clichés.In New Jersey, workaholic psychiatrist Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) meets with a traumatised PhD student named Laura (Caitlin Stasey), whom recently witnessed one of her professors commit suicide. Laura tells Rose about a frightening entity that takes the form of people with a large, fixated grin on their faces that is stalking her and repeatedly telling her she will die soon. Shortly after, Laura has a seizure and brutally takes her own life right in front of Rose. Later, Rose starts to experience similar situations to Laura, with unsettling, violent hallucinations following her everywhere she goes. Rose soon realises that in order to stop these terrifying occurrences, she must try to overcome her own troubled past before she becomes the entity's new victim.Out of all the subgenres of horror, I've always been attracted to the psychological aspect of the brand the most. This is primarily because I'm more geared towards finding scares in the collapsing mental well-being of the main character(s) since this seems like a more believable way to frighten viewers like me, as opposed to straight up blood and gore for the sake of it. Most importantly, by tapping into the realistic emotional breakdown of the character(s), we gain a better understanding of how what scares them can scare us just as effectively, and ""Smile"" uses this with the help of a classic psychological disorder that virtually everyone can understand - Trauma.Since trauma affects everyone in different ways, the film decides show this from just one person's perspective, in this case, through the eyes of Rose. What I liked most about Rose was that instead of a regular, run-of-the-mill everywoman, she is a psychiatrist; someone who specifically deals with treating mental disorders. In other words, this is a person whose profession requires her to be of sound mind and level-headedness, which means that when she experiences horrifying things, you really get the sense that she is actually suffering in spite of what is expected of someone in her line of work. There's a certain tragic element to watching a person in such a high position in her medical field slowly descend into madness, and the film pulls this off especially well.In his directorial debut, Parker Finn proves he has what it takes to hold his own among other horror filmmakers. Considering this is his first feature film, it is quite a relief to see that Finn already understands the key elements of a successful psychological horror movie. These include building suspense, establishing a creepy atmosphere, and above all, using the most simple situations to elicit a scare from the viewer. Perhaps best of all, most of the film's scariest parts didn't even involve jump scares. There are actually a handful of genuinely frightening parts in this film that really did startle me at times, some of which came completely out of nowhere. To speak at length would give away vital spoilers as well as ruin some of the film's most memorable moments so all I will say is make sure you are prepared for what's to come.But what I think worked best was how Finn invites the audience to understand everything Rose is going through in spite of what others around her are seeing. As mentioned previously, Rose is a psychiatrist whose job necessitates a particular level of composure. When Rose's horrifying hallucinations start to take a toll on her behaviour towards her closest associates, the once respected doctor becomes viewed as an insane person who has lost the plot, much like the very patients she is supposed to treat in the first place. Finn takes the opportunity to show Rose's decent into madness as something that is both scary and sad. As a result, the audience can feel sympathy for Rose during her breakdowns while at the same time feel afraid for her safety when attempting to solve the mystery of where this evil entity came from.Although the film works well for the first two thirds, it unfortunately starts to lose steam during the final act. Without spoiling the ending, I found the film's ultimate conclusion to be rather underwhelming, not terrible by any means but a bit of a letdown. It just seemed like for a film that went to so much trouble setting things up the way it did, this culmination of all the preceding events could have turned out a whole lot better. If I had to guess, I assume this may have been the result of Parker Finn's indecision as to whether he should finish the film either as a standalone feature or open for a possible sequel. Still, it's far from the very worst ending to a horror film that I've seen and if you're willing to overlook that, there are still plenty of other elements to appreciate.As the lead star, Sosie Bacon displays the perfect amount of emotional trauma required to bring a character like Rose to life. I like how Bacon depicts Rose as an intelligent individual instead of a typical horror movie bimbo who constantly makes bad choices. This made scenes where she is falling victim to the entity more emotionally involving because the audience now knows for sure that she would never deliberately indulge in some of the awful things she is being blamed for. In addition to making her more sympathetic, Bacon also shows a darker side to Rose's character, triggered by an event that occurred when she was only a child. Of course, I won't say what that event was due to spoilers but when it is revealed to the audience, it sheds a whole different light on Rose as a person.Despite its slightly disappointing ending, I would say that ""Smile"" stands as one of the more memorable horror films to be released in the past ten years. It succeeds at utilising its simple concept of fear-inducing personal trauma to leave an impression on any curious, unsuspecting audiences. If you're in the mood for a horror movie that earns its scares the correct way, then this should be in the realms of what you're looking for. Just don't forget to smile...

"First Impressions:I admit I wasn't even inclined to see this movie. I also admit I presumed it will be B-movie-boring. I now admit I was wrong. ""Smile"" will take several fans of the horror genre by surprise. There was an undertone of psychological thrill and deep paranormal mystery in this production. You won't wish to see a smiling person for a while once you're done watching this movie. Just as scary was the well-established (in the movie *gulp*) possibility that this 'condition' could pass on to anyone.The Crew:Parker Finn wrote and directed this movie. He deserves praise for weaving so much intricate detail into a plot that he also wrapped in a simple and linear storytelling style.Cristobal Tapia de Veer's musical scoring was excellent. Also, the artful use of silence worked wonders for this movie.Charlie Sarroff's cinematography made the scary scenes stand out. From panoramic shots oozing with suspense, to cunning angles that deceived, Charlie's work was praiseworthy.Great attention to detail by the art direction and editing teams.Production design certainly did justice to this script.VFX and stunts were noteworthy.Alexis Forte's costume design was neat.The Cast:Caitlin Stasey as Laura Weaver was exceptional.Sosie Bacon as Rose Cotter was remarkable.Jessie T. Usher as Trevor (Rose's fiancé) was amazing.Robin Weigert as Dr. Madeline Northcott (a therapist) was quite good.Jack Sochet as Carl Renken (a patient) was great.Perry Strong as Buckley (a detective) was good.Kyle Gallner as Joel (a detective) was notable.Kal Penn as Dr. Morgan Desai was good
Gillian Zinser as Holly (Rose's sister) was great.Nick Arapoglou as Greg (Holly's husband) was noteworthy.Ura Yoana Sánchez as Wanda (a nurse) had good comedic timing in that one scene.Judy Reyes as Victoria Muñoz (wife of one of the entity's victims) was outstanding.Rob Morgan as Robert Talley was superb. He was the 'odd victim out' in the story, and gave a memorable performance.Dora Kiss (Rose's mother) was credible and captivating.Plot Summary & Analysis:The story began in earnest when Laura Weaver (Caitlin Stasey) came in as the newest patient in a mental asylum. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) was the therapist assigned to her. In what was, to all intents and purposes, a normal everyday event, the team wove in elements of mystery and fear, particularly around Laura's smile, which inspired dire and sinister consequences.Did the smile itself cause the evils that unraveled in this movie? Or was the smile merely a warning of dark things to come? Your guess is as good as mine.I liked their approach with taking an educated and accomplished young woman and making her see things nobody else could. So far so unoriginal, right? Not exactly, because the team took the seemingly ordinary and gave it a horror-genre spin that felt at once fresh and terrifying.It was all so simple! That's what got to me. They never fully revealed the creature that was so much a part of this story. Those indirect smiley reveals were sufficient to send chills down any spine. In this regard, they expertly implemented the phrase 'fear of the unknown' in a story that seemed tailored for it.Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) and Trevor (Jessie T. Usher) made a nice on-screen couple. Their relationship was soon affected by the events that transpired surrounding Laura Weaver.After all, the creature was causing (perhaps even forcing) its victims to commit suicide. The creature then latched on to the first person who saw the suicide. Also, when the victims were alive and suffering the entity's presence, they were often made to see smiling people, most of whom were known to them (either still alive or passed away). Only they could see the smilers.I appreciated how the team kept such elements minimal in ""Smile"" so the main plot could progress seamlessly without irrelevant padding. This creative decision added to the fear factor and made the movie exponentially creepy.Finally, one anomaly in the victim spree - Robert Talley (Rob Morgan) - led Rose and Joel closer to the frightful truth of what in the heck was actually going on with all those who encountered this delusion-happy entity.Some fascinating subtext in this movie: if you don't face your demos, you will unwittingly spread them to others around you. That's just my take on a potential hidden message in the script.Final Notes:I admired how expertly they layered every scene and made it well-nigh impossible for even the most deduction-centric fans to predict how things would play out. I don't think I've seen a movie where a simple smile played the role of a compelling villain.In the short time she was on, Caitlin Stasey's natural performance sold the story. I have already started seeing smiles as a variation of fangs being bared, that's how eerie this movie made a simple expression seem ominous and terrifying.I believe ""Smile"" may well be the creepiest movie of the year. There was certainly some kind of trauma-hungry demonic entity wreaking bizarre mental havoc in this plot, but - and I am unnerved to say - the creature is still at large.They neither definitively ended its existence nor understood it enough to do so. That gaping hole of logic now seems like a bottomless abyss leading directly to some godawful place where a rictus smile can signal death or, worse, insanity.

"Ok so this wasn't too bad, the acting was good by everyone apart from her fiancé, I didn't find him to be the best actor.Apart from that some of the characters are really frustrating. I take this as a movie about mental health more than anything, and whether you believe your sister/partner/friend or not (most likely not) you'd still be like ""ok she's really going through something I need to stick by her and help her"". Their reactions drove me crazy.Plot wise I enjoyed it, it was something a bit new and fresh and there were a lot of jump scares but I didn't always expect them which is good. I watched it alone at night and got freaked out.Ending ruined it a bit - all they had to do was have the cop turn and run out of the house and not witness the suicide. Then end with you wondering if this means the curse is over.

"I was expecting this to be way less brutal than it was. The beginning scene was actual gold. I thought both Sosie and Caitlin did a fantastic and thrilling job. The rest of the film though, was very eerie and brutal. There was jumpscare after jumpscare after jumpscare which made it repetitive and you were waiting for something to happen for the next scene. Very self-explanatory and obvious film. One dies, another dies and so on. The visuals at the end were magnificent and very cool. I thought this film as a horror lover, was just alright.

"I ask myself if I removed character X, would it affect the story? Would it change the outcome in any way? Would it help tighten the story if I did? Well, in this case, there are several character X's. First, the fiancee. Pointless. He added nothing of value. The Sister. Again, pointless. She was there only to add drama and dump some exposition on us. The Sister's husband and son? Again, pointless. It seemed like they were setting something up with the nephew for it only to go nowhere.If they had removed those characters, they could have focused more on the main story. Maybe fill in some of the gaps? Some backstory, some more scenes with the mother, more with her therapist.And removing those characters would also have brought the running time down to about 1:37, which is where it should have been, in my opinion.I don't mind jumpscares, but the setup has to be done right. Some in here were, some weren't. I also am not a fan of a tense scene, in this case when the therapist visits her but isn't really the therapist, and she grabs her, has her up against the wall and then just cuts to her in her car. What? Any tension, any fright that just built up was completely taken away. Also, it makes no sense.Now, I know it sounds like I'm bagging on the film, and I guess I am, but I did enjoy a good amount of it. Unlike a lot of people, I didn't mind the ending. I saw it coming a mile away, but I didn't mind it. It's a horror film. You want a happy ending, find an Asian massage parlor.I have seen a trend lately with ""horror"" films where when they are written and directed by the same person, they are usually underwhelming. I'm not saying bad, just like, they need someone else (like a writer), to bounce ideas off or something. Even ""revered"" movies like Hereditary or The Witch, which I personally think both of them are WAY overrated, could have benefited from another person (or people) to question certain choices.And PS...this is NOT the worst movie you have ever seen, nor is it the best. It's far from a 1 and not close to a 10. People really need to lay off the hyperbole.

"I went to see this movie and I went in completely blind with my girlfriend. This movie had her and I freaked out for a while after and we weren't handling the movie that well. I haven't been that scared of a movie since Annabelle and this has definitely set the bar very high for the upcoming horror movies. This movie does has times where it is slow but then it is followed up with amazing plot twists, storytelling, and just very good acting in general. The actors are phenomenal in this and this an amazing movie that many horror fanatics will love! Not to mention the reason how I even found out about this movie which was putting out freaky actors behind home in a MLB games and putting another freaky actor behind GMA, the advertising for this movie was fantastic.",went see movie went completely blind girlfriend movie freaked handling movie well scared movie since annabelle definitely set bar high upcoming horror movie movie time slow followed amazing plot twist storytelling good acting general actor phenomenal amazing movie many horror fanatic love mention reason even found movie putting freaky actor behind home mlb game putting another freaky actor behind gma advertising movie fantastic
"Ok... this is one of those films where you either love it or hate it. This was one of those movies where I disagreed with other reviews to the point where I had to write my own. 1) I am a horror junkie. So, dear fellow reviewer, speak for yourself. Fellow horror fans should watch this one and see how they feel. 2) As someone else claimed, I am not a paid reviewer. 3) And, 3 was perhaps the worst. I HATE TIKTOK. The word itself is enough to make me cringe. Now that I got that out of the way... I need to say that I felt Smile was very jarring. Not necessarily because of the plot itself, but because of how it was shot. It left me feeling disoriented and very uneasy. As for someone that mentioned smiling at death, I believe that was commentary on how we're expected to grin and bare it, even when we're dying inside/suffering. I think Smile also did well painting a dire picture of being desperate for connection and understanding and being met with revulsion and isolation instead. I'd say smile was a scathing criticism on society and mental health. And even if you take nothing from any of it, I would hope you'd admit that it was a bit intense in some places. Because the nephew's birthday scene was particularly bad and that will stay with me. But perhaps what was even worse was the fact that you figure out that one sibling is suffering so intensely and the other one just goes on living in complete naivety droning on about pilates and when it becomes clear just how bad things have gotten the sister doubles down and continues on like nothing ever happened.

"Smile? Give me a billion dollars, and I may just do that. Two billion would be nicer, though.What is this, the sequel to ""Smiley?""
I must point out that I borrowed this movie from the library and didn't support it financially, as today's modern movies aren't worth a bag of dirt.Man, I'm like a broken record, repeating myself saying this all the time.I try to give these movies the benefit of the doubt, but they continue to prove how inept the current WGAs are, and they should stay on strike or just go away and be replaced.I mean, here it is, the future, and I thought movies would be flawless and worth every penny, but we've gone backward and got carried away with computer imagery, which doesn't enhance the viewing experience in any way.If this movie can prove me wrong, then I'll apologize.""Smile"" starts with a woman in the outback overdosing on prescription medicine while a little hitman sees to it that she remains dead.Then that NKOTB ""Sixth Sense"" dead guy is back and rambling about dying again.Is this some puzzle movie where the answer lies in the first few scenes?It looks like Amy Adams and Katie Holmes are in therapy, and everything's chaotic and frantic, with camera angles ridiculously placed in extreme closeups.Don't tell me this is going to be one of those artsy ""It Follows"" clones. I never understood the hype about that banality.Wow, new and innovative filming techniques where everything's upside down.Didn't ""Midsommar"" do this already?How does that improve the viewing experience by filming upside down? What's the director relaying to the audience exactly?Is he like, ""Hey look, nobody's done this before.""
It's plain stupid, and we don't live like George McFly from ""Back to the Future 2"" in some flying palliative device where the world's all topsy-turvy.Who are any of the actors in this?How am I supposed to like the movie when I don't even care for the actors?Is that Al Bundy? He's still alive?Whoever this actress is, Robyn Lively, she's in no position to be assessing others mental well-being when she herself is unstable and on edge.How many times is she going to cry in this movie?Oh, I get it; it's going to be another ""Shutter Island"" where she only thinks she's a doctor but is actually an inpatient, right?You're not going to score any points on my rating with all these cheap jump scares.Is that Jennifer Garner?The movie's not doing anything for me.Dip dip dip dip sha na na sha na na na.That was in ""Stand by Me,"" right?Your whole 50s soundtrack, end credit song included, doesn't match the movie.You haven't even gotten off zero points on my scorecard.Wow, here's a qualified therapist who's now suddenly mentally ill and asking a shrink to prescribe her Risperdal as she's self-diagnosed herself as schizophrenic.To anyone out there reading this, whatever you do, don't take psychotropic medication, as your weight will balloon.And if it's not asking too much, could any future movie director please limit the use of the F word in their movies? It's been overused and has no impact anymore.A lot of these F-bombs are unnecessary.I just heard a soundbite from Tangerine Dream's Zeit album.As much as I hate animal cruelty and own cats myself, that birthday scene with the gift to the kid would be the ultimate payback to your enemies, I mean family.Wipe that stupid smile off the little spoilt so and so's face.Sorry, but I stopped writing way back when what's-her-name wanted the prescription from the doctor.I'm sitting here like a zombie from those numerous living dead sort of films, staring at my bedroom floor.A trusted therapist in the beginning quickly becomes fragile and susceptible to illusions from ""It Follows,"" then goes on a quest to track down deceased victims with tons of unnecessary swearing along the way, and apparently Jim Carey's ""The Mask"" is some sort of body hopper who force-feeds himself inside people and has no motive or reason for an existence to even begin with but inserts himself nonetheless.That ending where The Mask is force-feeding into the girl reminds me of that 90s music video clip where a monster is eating someone in similar fashion.It'll drive me nuts to know what song I'm actually referring to.Um, I thought it was Chemical Brothers Block Rockin' Beats, but it's not. Was it something by The Prodigy? I forget.In conclusion, I'm too much of an old-school fan and don't care for today's entertainment. I was raised on Jason, Myers, and ""Evil Dead.""

"This psychological horror deals with Dr. Rose, someone with a personal trauma, getting assigned a new case of PhD student Laura who has witnessed the suicide of her professor. Rose thinks it's a case of PTSD bur all is what it seems after Laura admits to being followed by an entity feeding off her trauma. As Rose tries to find a rational reason for Laura's behaviour, she witness her commit suicide with a smile. From hereon, Rose's world gets turned upside down as she fails to figure out whether the entity is real or if she is going mentally insane while her therapist, co-workers to even her loved ones dismiss her fears for a much plausible scientific reason. Rose turns to the officer who is assigned her case for help, to unearth this mystery.This definitely has a credible idea and I even understand the challenges in making a feature film out of a short film. Yet, the film firmly lies in the shadow of The Ring mainly as one cannot ignore the familiar tropes the screenplay follows. This undermines the key scenes as the predictability kicked in hard. The performances were good yet the whole investigating on the mysterious phenomenon looked a bit dragged while Rose's mental health kept going down as she nears the deadline. Sure, they could build up for a sequel or a prequel, like any probable franchise content goes, this however could've benefitted from few more scary scenes. It did get bloody occasionally but the brief encounter with the entity rather looked unfulfilled.I do appreciate that ending, it held my attention and so the 3 star rating without being lenient.

"Went into this movie with huge hopes seeing how highly rated it was, but unfortunately all but 2-3 scary parts are literally shown in the trailer. The scary parts that were left out definitely gave me chills, but I am not sure if it was enough to recommend people go spend their money to see it. And let me clarify, by scary parts I mean jumpscares, because unfortunately the big bad evil in the movie was pretty underwhelming. Additionally, the entire plot felt very famililiar, and besides the smiling aspect never really introduced anything new to the genre.

"SMILE :)Smile is the best movie I've seen this year and the scariest. It had a terrific story where the twists added up and had hardly any restraint. The story deals with a psychiatrist at the hospital who's recent patient has plagues of family members and friends staring hideously at her to the point where she can't control her moods. The faces usually smilie and soon it consumes her to the point of suicide. She then researches this demonic situation to something more horrific. There were a few abrupt scenes that I would've like more of a scene before it cuts to the next, but it was honestly disturbing and unexpected in its timing of scares. The story has similar themes of Insidious or Conjuring or The Entity, but with surprises in terms of the villian as well as the journey the lead character is suffering through.",smile smile best movie seen year scariest terrific story twist added hardly restraint story deal psychiatrist hospital recent patient plague family member friend staring hideously point control mood face usually smilie soon consumes point suicide research demonic situation something horrific abrupt scene would like scene cut next honestly disturbing unexpected timing scare story similar theme insidious conjuring entity surprise term villian well journey lead character suffering
"It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since a movie based on a cursed videotape scared its way through theaters. It's only fitting that 2022 would bring us another sleeper horror hit in 'Smile.'The low-budget ""pass it on""-style viral film succeeds due to its simplicity, trading in elaborate sets and production value for a straightforward, linear plot that actually works due to the intense fear factor. Despite having a low-profile cast, there are convincing performances from Sosie Bacon and Robin Weigert, among others. There are enough jump scares, but not too many to make 'Smile' feel cheap, and the opening scene is one of the most memorable (and disturbing) in quite some time.To be clear, 'Smile' isn't perfect. While there are a few twists and turns, the ending is pretty predictable, which is hard to avoid in this genre these days. But overall, it delivers where it needs to and exceeds expectations.",hard believe year since movie based cursed videotape scared way theater fitting would bring u another sleeper horror hit smile low budget pas style viral film succeeds due simplicity trading elaborate set production value straightforward linear plot actually work due intense fear factor despite low profile cast convincing performance sosie bacon robin weigert among others enough jump scare many make smile feel cheap opening scene one memorable disturbing quite time clear smile perfect twist turn ending pretty predictable hard avoid genre day overall delivers need exceeds expectation
"In Smile, Rose begins to suffer from the same hallucinations that drove her patient to suicide. Tormented by an apparent entity that takes the form of people with a grim smile, Rose must find answers to her condition before paranoia consumes her.Smile is a mid-budget film, albeit financed by Paramount Pictures. With a promising script, Smile innovates in the antagonist, but the main plot is shallow, without depth.The film is dark. I feel psychological horror movies are always terrifying. The plot plays with the idea of subjectivity, with the possibility that Rose is just having a nervous breakdown. But that's the boring part of the movie, even if it's scary. When Rose decides to get her hands dirty, we're already in the second half of Smile, and that's when things take shape.The entity itself is disturbing. The smiles in general are macabre, but Caitlin Stasey steals the show with her disturbing smile.Rose's character is a bit obnoxious. Her selfishness, a failure born of her traumas, makes her irritating, making her susceptible to neglect on the part of the audience. Maybe if Rose had someone she cared about besides herself, Rose might be kinder, more pitiable. Most of the time, Rose makes decisions that cause distress and discontent, leading the audience to possibly root against her.The visual effects compact with the average budget. Some scenes are realistic, while others use mediocre computer graphics that are impossible to ignore.The final events are tense and well-constructed. However, Smile ends with a feeling of hopelessness that embitters the experience, making its long 115-minute runtime wasted. Smile makes room for a sequel, but we'll see if it's box office success will be enough. Only time will tell; what is left for us is to smile.",smile rose begin suffer hallucination drove patient suicide tormented apparent entity take form people grim smile rose must find answer condition paranoia consumes smile mid budget film albeit financed paramount picture promising script smile innovates antagonist main plot shallow without depth film dark feel psychological horror movie always terrifying plot play idea subjectivity possibility rose nervous breakdown boring part movie even scary rose decides get hand dirty already second half smile thing take shape entity disturbing smile general macabre caitlin stasey steal show disturbing smile rose character bit obnoxious selfishness failure born trauma make irritating making susceptible neglect part audience maybe rose someone cared besides rose might kinder pitiable time rose make decision cause distress discontent leading audience possibly root visual effect compact average budget scene realistic others use mediocre computer graphic impossible ignore final event tense well constructed however smile end feeling hopelessness embitters experience making long minute runtime wasted smile make room sequel see box office success enough time tell left u smile
"Last summer, I saw that someone promoting this movie was smiling creepily at an Oakland A's home game, which happens to be my favorite team. I was intrigued. And that smile, well, like the picture above, it's super creepy all on its own. Felt like a winning idea for a scary picture!I did very much enjoy this film! The jump-scares got me several times! And I liked the way the character of Rose fell apart, both mentally and in physically. They did a great job with the makeup, and I think Sosie Bacon played it perfectly! I actually wanted to rank this higher, but I had one overwhelming thought bounce around my head as the plot unfolded. The basic idea of what was happening to the doctor, and 19 some odd people before, is the same basic idea that occurs in the movie ""Fallen"" with Denzel Washington. So much so, that I actually started wondering if this was some type of remake of that movie! I guess it isn't, but still...
So, if you haven't seen ""Fallen"", I think you will enjoy this movie a great deal!

"The only scary part about this movie is the jump scares which happen like every 10 minutes. The plot itself is boring and it's a predictable movie it wasn't really scary at all there was a lot of unanswered questions and it was just like of a boring watch. Don't think I'd ever watch it again personally, maybe it would scare little kids I don't know. The one thing good about this movie i will say is that the main character will hallucinate an entire scene and you think it's happening but it's not actually and then she'll wake up from it and come back to her senses that was pretty cool. I give it a 2/10 overall I would say it just needs more depth and more scare factors other then just pop ups.",scary part movie jump scare happen like every minute plot boring predictable movie really scary lot unanswered question like boring watch think ever watch personally maybe would scare little kid know one thing good movie say main character hallucinate entire scene think happening actually wake come back sens pretty cool give overall would say need depth scare factor pop ups
"At least it's a good move for horror genre, that should be enough. It would be better if only the runtime alone doesn't exceed 90 minutes, and if the film focused more on the scientific side, like hallucinations. E.g. Ghosts are just fairy tales, and there may try to prove scientifically that everyone has their own ghost.

"Upfront, I recommend seeing this in the theater. The sound effects, the darkened atmosphere, and just the overall feel is best complimented in the movie theater. Unless of course you have a surround sound. I'm sure it will still be great without, but some movies were just meant to be watched in the theater. Now, IMO this is arguably the scariest movie of the year if not decade. It really rivals ""It Follows"". The only difference is that creepy, eery smile on every character before you die instead of being slowly chased by random people walking at a glacial pace. Definitely, some jump scares. My only problem was the ending. I think the ending wasn't bad, it wasn't perfect, but definitely could have ended a lot darker since the entire movie came off like that. Still, overall enjoyable!",upfront recommend seeing theater sound effect darkened atmosphere overall feel best complimented movie theater unless course surround sound sure still great without movie meant watched theater imo arguably scariest movie year decade really rival follows difference creepy eery smile every character die instead slowly chased random people walking glacial pace definitely jump scare problem ending think ending bad perfect definitely could ended lot darker since entire movie came like still overall enjoyable

"The idea itself is not a problem. The real problem with this movie is, the movie itself isn't scary at all, it's just full of random jumpscares. Turning on the volume randomly 200% doesn't make your film scary. Any movie can be a horror with this method, even a cartoon for kids.As a huge horror fan, I was able to predict EVERY single jumpscare before they happened because the movie is so predictible.Like I've said the movie main idea is good, but I'm not gonna give this an avarage rating because I'm so sick and tired these types of movies are the standards now.Movies like these are for younger people or very unexperienced watchers.",idea problem real problem movie movie scary full random jumpscares turning volume randomly make film scary movie horror method even cartoon kid huge horror fan able predict every single jumpscare happened movie predictible like said movie main idea good gonna give avarage rating sick tired type movie standard movie like younger people unexperienced watcher
"Not sure if it's just me or if this movie was better or not. I'm going to have to do a rewatch. The premise is good, and there are plenty of jump scares.. but for me they didn't really make me jump at all. I did however hear other people jumping out of their seats, so it could be just me. I watch a ton of scary flicks so I may be more desensitized to them than most.The story seemed all over the place for me, but it was shot really well, I'm really going to have to rewatch it to figure out a more accurate rating for it.

The movie is creepy, great scares, cool idea and some awesome imagery.Again - this can definitely affect how you watch the movie so decide if you want to read this before or after you see the movie -One thing I noticed right away that no one else in the theater seemed to see, even when I pointed it out to the people I was with - the red and green pixelation / distortion of the people who are part of the demon or what it's making the victim see. Starting with the first victim in the hospital you'll briefly (like for a quarter of a second) see her mouth distort into red and green pixels or blocks, almost the way a 3-D screen looks when you don't have glasses on. From that point, whenever something is about to happen or if the person on screen is the demon not really the person you'll get that super quick glitch effect.

"The story has been told many times before about a traveling evil spirit. Nothing new there. I think the idea was to see the mail character spiral into madness. Instead I found it incredible predictable and extremely frustrating watching the main character doing pretty much the worst things she could do in every situation. Shes pretty unaware of the human mind considering she is a psychiatrist herself... You can always blame every irrational decision on personal trauma, but it just feels too easy to that - and it makes it pretty predictable all the way through. Good acting all the way through and the Bob feel (Twin Peaks) from the evil entity is effective. You can like or dislike jump scares - to me it is a cheap trick and not really scary. Too slow through many scenes as well, trying to build a mood I never got.",story told many time traveling evil spirit nothing new think idea see mail character spiral madness instead found incredible predictable extremely frustrating watching main character pretty much worst thing could every situation shes pretty unaware human mind considering psychiatrist always blame every irrational decision personal trauma feel easy make pretty predictable way good acting way bob feel twin peak evil entity effective like dislike jump scare cheap trick really scary slow many scene well trying build mood never got
"Smile, at first glance to me was another run-of-the-mill teenage camp fest. And sure enough, it was in terms of the plot and characters. Every single pivotal point in the movie was so predictable that it was laughable. However! There are GOOD things here to view in the movie: the horror itself is quite interesting and unsettling but there are so many cliches it hurts the film more than it deserves.Aside from all of that, I'd wait till streaming. Just isn't worth your $20 to go see something you've seen done several times in other films, and you deserve to watch a horror film that doesn't bore you with the same thing over and over.

"I enjoyed the slow burn pace through the first half of the movie, the cinematography and sound create a great sense of tension and a creepy atmosphere, together with decent acting and an interesting premise with enough mystery to keep the interest.But soon, I felt it was dragging too much, I wasn't seeing enough development on the main character who was going around aimlessly and completely lack of ideas, not a very clever one, hard to root for.Ultimately, it ended up being a big clichÃ©, wasting a few opportunities for a twist or a real closure as a story.It sadly fell into the classic (not in a good way) horror movie ending, obviously aiming to continue as a series.I doubt I'll come back to it if I'll keep watching this over and over again.I really feel like this could have been much more as a story, with a better ending and a better resolution, its potential was wasted.Still, it's an interesting, technically decent watch.",enjoyed slow burn pace first half movie cinematography sound create great sense tension creepy atmosphere together decent acting interesting premise enough mystery keep interest soon felt dragging much seeing enough development main character going around aimlessly completely lack idea clever one hard root ultimately ended big clich wasting opportunity twist real closure story sadly fell classic good way horror movie ending obviously aiming continue series doubt come back keep watching really feel like could much story better ending better resolution potential wasted still interesting technically decent watch
"Many act like jump scares are somehow cheap, but when well done, as they are in this film, they are great. But this film doesn't rely solely on them, as it's also a bit gory, creepy, shocking, and downright terrifying throughout. The sound and filming create a perfectly creepy and disturbing atmosphere that is well enhanced by its important message: the effect of trauma on happiness, and how through even the most extreme trauma most people just put on a happy face and pretend nothing is wrong. Trauma is passed on and impossible to ever move on from completely, and these are the underlying themes of this very well done film. There is hidden meaning along these themes in every scene if you want to something to think about.A must see in the theater, truly terrifying for most people.",many act like jump scare somehow cheap well done film great film rely solely also bit gory creepy shocking downright terrifying throughout sound filming create perfectly creepy disturbing atmosphere well enhanced important message effect trauma happiness even extreme trauma people put happy face pretend nothing wrong trauma passed impossible ever move completely underlying theme well done film hidden meaning along theme every scene want something think must see theater truly terrifying people

"Finally found some time to watch this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. It does fall short though, seems to be missing an opportunity to be an excellent horror.

"I feel like this is an example of when a filmmaker sits down and says, what are a few of my favorite horror movies/shows, and then extracts some dramatic and storytelling devices from each and tries to make a new thing. Often this experiment fails. I submit that for Smile it worked, even while I was conscious of the borrowings while I was watching. My take is that the sources of inspiration for this are The Outsider (Stephen King/HBO), It Follows and The Ring. How can I hate on those influences?! I'm sure there are other elements too but those stood out. All combined, this movie kept me on edge the whole time. I loved the cinematography with a lot of long shots that allowed me to examine all the corners of a set. Plus, I think the new horror-favorite Dutch camera angle is to now have a drone shot that turns upside down-very unnerving! I'm sure it was probably done before, but I credit Ari Aster using it to great effect early on in Midsommar to let the viewer know, things ain't right. I agree with another reviewer how unfortunate it is that horror movie actors are never considered for Oscar noms (hello Toni Collette in Hereditary!). I don't know if Sosi Bacon's performance would completely rise to that level of deservedness, but I'll be damned if she didn't completely sell this roll with her whole being. Without her performance I don't know how a viewer could have empathized with the condition of absolute fear and sense of losing one's mind. I didn't give this movie a 10/10 because there were a couple annoying plot elements that took me out of disbelief suspension, mostly just how those closest to her turned their backs on her so easily, especially her sister and fiancé. It seemed like she had no previous history to cause them to cut bait so decisively. Just weird that they had a one strike and you're out policy. Maybe there were scenes left on the cutting room floor that would have explained that better?",feel like example filmmaker sits say favorite horror movie show extract dramatic storytelling device try make new thing often experiment fails submit smile worked even conscious borrowing watching take source inspiration outsider stephen king hbo follows ring hate influence sure element stood combined movie kept edge whole time loved cinematography lot long shot allowed examine corner set plus think new horror favorite dutch camera angle drone shot turn upside unnerving sure probably done credit ari aster using great effect early midsommar let viewer know thing right agree another reviewer unfortunate horror movie actor never considered oscar noms hello toni collette hereditary know sosi bacon performance would completely rise level deservedness damned completely sell roll whole without performance know viewer could empathized condition absolute fear sense losing one mind give movie couple annoying plot element took disbelief suspension mostly closest turned back easily especially sister fianc seemed like previous history cause cut bait decisively weird one strike policy maybe scene left cutting room floor would explained better

"The movie is not really a horror, part psychological mental and the other is scare and run, actors performance is mediocre.

Very slow pace for the first 60 minutes, and while the psychological part of the movie would require a proper build up, it was very slow, then suddenly let's catch up in last 30 minutes.The idea might be nice, but the production and acting made it just a waste of idea, could have been done in a much better way with proper actors and proper equipment.",movie really horror part psychological mental scare run actor performance mediocre realize absence focus total lack direction area conversation camera light real poor would expect better work camera light movie hold paramount picture slow pace first minute psychological part movie would require proper build slow suddenly let catch last minute idea might nice production acting made waste idea could done much better way proper actor proper equipment
"Typical for this genre: this could have been a really good movie. Unfortunately what it lacks in smart scriptwriting it just makes up for in effects (sound and goryness). The central idea is good, unfortunately very little is done to follow it through. Not a movie that pays much respects to people struggling with mental illness.Possibly the grading here is harsh, but a film lives or dies by its script. Digging deeper into the scary main theme of the film would both have made for a better plot, and given the chance to add some sense. Sure, horror movies are often not realistic by nature, but I found this an insult to my limited intellect.",typical genre could really good movie unfortunately lack smart scriptwriting make effect sound goryness central idea good unfortunately little done follow movie pay much respect people struggling mental illness possibly grading harsh film life dy script digging deeper scary main theme film would made better plot given chance add sense sure horror movie often realistic nature found insult limited intellect
"What always gets to me about movies like this one is the fact that the solution is blatantly obvious after about 20 minutes. You know how the smile is passed on from one victim to the other and how this could be broken and then the main character who is supposed to be an intelligent person is unable to connect the simplest dots. It takes her police friend to figure out the connections and then an alternate solution is provided by someone else who was able to break the chain. Once it is established there needs to be a witness for the smile to be passed on in either a murder or a suicide, breaking the chain would be as simple as dying without a witness.Finally making the connection our doctor has a lovely phone call with her police buddy while trying to be secluded and cant think of how traceable she is due to her phone which she should not bring.That is where the entire movie lost me at last as it became incredibly unbelievable. The ending was clear once you see the phone ringing again in her car and you know Joel is going to come for her.Lost all suspense that exact moment and the entire last 35 minutes are just a waste of time that deliver nothing besides some additional ""scare"" moments.2 bad!",always get movie like one fact solution blatantly obvious minute know smile passed one victim could broken main character supposed intelligent person unable connect simplest dot take police friend figure connection alternate solution provided someone else able break chain established need witness smile passed either murder suicide breaking chain would simple dying without witness finally making connection doctor lovely phone call police buddy trying secluded cant think traceable due phone bring entire movie lost last became incredibly unbelievable ending clear see phone ringing car know joel going come lost suspense exact moment entire last minute waste time deliver nothing besides additional scare moment bad
"The movie had it moments , at times the story picked up and would move in the right direction and then it would kind of get sidetracked. The acting for the most part was average at best. It took too long to really let everyone know what was going on. If it would have introduced that earlier and developed it the movie would have been much better in this viewers opinion. In the end I gave it a 6 which in my book means it is watchable. I was kind of on the fence until the last 20 minutes or so wondering how it was going to wrap up. Unfortunately , the ending let me down and was a little like , well ok i guess so. But it kind of went in a direction that didn't seem to fit the entire movie.

"I enjoyed it!Of course, there are some flaws to the movie such as a patient wearing shoe strings, a glass vase being in a room with a patient, and some of the scares in the ending feeling like they were ripped off of other movies; however, to me these are not deal breakers.I'm not sure where the writer was going, but when I finished the movie, I felt as if the smile ""curse,"" was a curse inspired by the true horror of historical/generational/shared trauma. Like I said, I'm not sure where the writers were going with that, and if it's their intention, but I like to tell myself it was, as it's fantastic.When you experience a trauma in life, especially one that is shared, it spreads just like this curse. Everyone gets hurt by it.Of course, it was terrifying for the main character to experience the symptoms of this curse and have no one believe her. Everyone chalks it up to psychosis. As a mental health professional, I felt instant sadness and guilt. Imagine if someone came to me saying the same thing? My clinical notes would include visual and auditory hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and insomnia. That scares me, because we would attribute it to mental illness, but it's really a curse? That's *terrifying* to me. I loved it.

"Very quickly into this I got It Follows vibes and I, personally, do not like that movie. Yes, there were some great, creepy visuals in both of the movies, but I'll always love Fallen (1998) most for a movie where evil gets passed on from one to another.In Smile, we see Sosie Bacon play Dr. Rose Cotter. While Sosie does great at acting like she's falling apart and going crazy, she is not at all believable as a therapist. The limited interaction we see her have with patients just isn't good. Her lack of urgency when calling for help to deal with Laura and her failure to do anything upon seeing a weapon in the hand of the patient she was evaluating was aggravating. She made zero effort to talk the woman down before harm was done.Sticking with this after that moment, we see Rose getting no support from her fiancée who now seems worried that he's attached himself to a nutter. Rose's apparent ex, Joel, is much more helpful, though, when he's brought back into her life as one of the cops taking Rose's statement regarding what she saw Laura do.When Rose visits the widow of Laura's dead professor and is told how the man said it was trying or wanted in him, I had a pretty good theory of what happens. Whatever this thing is, it attaches to you and torments you until you finally break and let it in, like we saw happen with Laura. Once it's in, you get the maniacal grin as a clue before ""it"" kills that victim, though it appears they're killing themselves. In her search for answers, Joel and Rose find one person who ""survived"" and he had to kill an innocent person to do it. So this thing wants a life and a witness to pass suffering on to. Rose seems to think that she can kill it, but I thought her only choice would be to kill herself without a witness to break the cycle. We were both wrong. Once this thing has you, it HAS you. It made Rose believe she had defeated it only to show her that that was all a mind game it was playing. It wasn't going die or let Rose die without a witness to move on to. I don't really know how I feel about that realization and the ending. I think I got what they were trying to say, but it was just anticlimactic. The pacing of this was just too slow to pack the punch I'm sure they wanted with that ending or maybe I've just seem this idea played out too many times now. In the end, I'm just disappointed because it's yet another new release that put all the best bits in the trailer and fails to deliver with the actual movie.",quickly got follows vibe personally like movie yes great creepy visuals movie always love fallen movie evil get passed one another smile see sosie bacon play dr rose cotter sosie great acting like falling apart going crazy believable therapist limited interaction see patient good lack urgency calling help deal laura failure anything upon seeing weapon hand patient evaluating aggravating made zero effort talk woman harm done sticking moment see rose getting support fianc e seems worried attached nutter rose apparent ex joel much helpful though brought back life one cop taking rose statement regarding saw laura rose visit widow laura dead professor told man said trying wanted pretty good theory happens whatever thing attache torment finally break let like saw happen laura get maniacal grin clue kill victim though appears killing search answer joel rose find one person survived kill innocent person thing want life witness pas suffering rose seems think kill thought choice would kill without witness break cycle wrong thing made rose believe defeated show mind game playing going die let rose die without witness move really know feel realization ending think got trying say anticlimactic pacing slow pack punch sure wanted ending maybe seem idea played many time end disappointed yet another new release put best bit trailer fails deliver actual movie
"I really didn't understand why this movie was getting so much hype, it seemed like a plot that had been done before similarly. But once it came to streaming, I figured I would watch it. Overall, I was pretty impressed with the jump scares and overall feel. There was a few plot holes but I always like to give the benefit of the doubt and judge for the big picture.Sosie Bacon was a decent lead in this film as Dr Rose Cotter, a therapist. Who is quite familiar with psychology and her patients. Until there is a mystery that ensnares her mind as well. She works to put together the pieces for an almost good ending. I will say, I thought it would have been stronger if the last 60 seconds were a bit different and less cheesy. Otherwise, pretty solid horror all around.",really understand movie getting much hype seemed like plot done similarly came streaming figured would watch overall pretty impressed jump scare overall feel plot hole always like give benefit doubt judge big picture sosie bacon decent lead film dr rose cotter therapist quite familiar psychology patient mystery ensnares mind well work put together piece almost good ending say thought would stronger last second bit different le cheesy otherwise pretty solid horror around
"This is not a bad horror film, it's well acted, a unsettling score and eerie atmosphere does work for what it wants to achieve. The themes of trauma, and depression are shoved in your face of look this film has real life meaning. We get it, some people smile through depression and trauma.

A solid horror movie. For the directors first movie he did a good job. It was easy to see he was inspired by It Follows & the American version of The Ring while still being an original concept. Acting & pacing were good.My only complaint with this movie was the sound design. I think maybe they didn't feel certain scenes couldn't carry the scare so they did it by blasting everyone's ear drums. A lot of people in the theatre we're talking about it jump scaring them for the noise not the actual scene. I think some scenes would've been truly disturbing if maybe they were silent. Less is more in that department but still good for a watch. It'll interesting to see what they do next.,solid horror movie director first movie good job easy see inspired follows american version ring still original concept acting pacing good complaint movie sound design think maybe feel certain scene carry scare blasting everyone ear drum lot people theatre talking jump scaring noise actual scene think scene would truly disturbing maybe silent le department still good watch interesting see next
"It wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen. But it did leave a little room for how 'campy' the film was. I suppose that's mostly because there didn't seem to be a busy storyline. It's like X would happen, then 10 minutes later Y would happen, and if you're lucky, in another 10 minutes Z would happen.Not very thought provoking, certainly a movie you could walk out in the middle, go to the bathroom, refill the popcorn, have a smoke, and then come back in - and you really didn't miss anything.My guess is they put a bunch of ideas in a hat, then drew 1 every 10 minutes to make a movie. Again, all the ideas in the hat were good, maybe they could have drawn more than every 10 minutes - you see what I'm saying? No depth!RECOMMEND: As far as horror goes, it's definitely watchable!",worst horror movie ever seen leave little room campy film suppose mostly seem busy storyline like x would happen minute later would happen lucky another minute z would happen thought provoking certainly movie could walk middle go bathroom refill popcorn smoke come back really miss anything guess put bunch idea hat drew every minute make movie idea hat good maybe could drawn every minute see saying depth recommend far horror go definitely watchable

"The latter part of title is the most important, in my opinion, because it was offensive how the protagonist's loved ones treated her during her break downs (a little creative writing was all that was needed to have them help her, rather than be insensitive, or outright reject her). If this movie had been made just ten year ago, I could understand this treatmeant of mental health for the sake of horror. But, this movie is from 2022.In above to the complaint, the movie did not need to be as long as it was to tell the story. Oh, and it was a weak 'monster'.

"I felt like I was watching the cinematography from Insidious and Conjuring. As the story goes, it felt similar to The Ring, where the main character has a clock counting down to their potential death.Sosie Bacon takes after her father and puts on an incredible performance. Kal Penn and Kyle Gallner also support with excellence.Overall, this one was able to make me feel pretty uneasy. Despite seeing the previews and slightly seeing parts of certain scenes, I still had to keep reminding myself that this is only a movie.Parker Finn in his feature directorial debut hits a homerun. Much like Jordan Peele with Get Out, Finn uses creative camera angles and lighting to really hit some peaks of disturbing imagery.This film also puts your own fears of nightmares never ended even if they seem like it's over. I do believe there is massive potential for a sequel to continue more of this universe.While the jump scares were predictable, the psychological aspect really digs deep and can unnerve you for the entire day. This was definitely worth the wait.",felt like watching cinematography insidious conjuring story go felt similar ring main character clock counting potential death sosie bacon take father put incredible performance kal penn kyle gallner also support excellence overall one able make feel pretty uneasy despite seeing preview slightly seeing part certain scene still keep reminding movie parker finn feature directorial debut hit homerun much like jordan peele get finn us creative camera angle lighting really hit peak disturbing imagery film also put fear nightmare never ended even seem like believe massive potential sequel continue universe jump scare predictable psychological aspect really dig deep unnerve entire day definitely worth wait
"Overall the movie does a pretty good job with staying scary while not becoming corny. There are a lot of horror movies where the line is crossed and instead of scary the movie just becomes silly.The concept of the movie I didn't find to be particularly original as I've seen others with the concept of passing on a curse. Still, in this one the actors do a fine job , particularly the lead actress . The sound also is very well done and situationally appropriate.The camera work also is very well done. They are able to get just the right angles on scenes to really make you wonder where the jump scare is going to come from. They also have just the right amount of jump scare moments that doesn't overwhelm but keeps you engaged.My major issue with it was that it seemed they didn't really have a good way of ending it, but this Is often the case even with the best of horror flicks.A final recommendation would be to try and view this film at times where the theatre is not busy. The nature of the movie certainly attracts young teens trying to flex to each other how brave they are (or how terrified in many cases) and this group has the tendency of being overly loud and disruptive to the viewing experience.Overall in the context of the quality of other horror movies this is above average and a pretty good October Halloween season spook.",overall movie pretty good job staying scary becoming corny lot horror movie line crossed instead scary movie becomes silly concept movie find particularly original seen others concept passing curse still one actor fine job particularly lead actress sound also well done situationally appropriate camera work also well done able get right angle scene really make wonder jump scare going come also right amount jump scare moment overwhelm keep engaged major issue seemed really good way ending often case even best horror flick final recommendation would try view film time theatre busy nature movie certainly attracts young teen trying flex brave terrified many case group tendency overly loud disruptive viewing experience overall context quality horror movie average pretty good october halloween season spook

"If you like a good horror movie, then SMILE is going to bring a smile to your face. It is writer and director, Parker Finn's, first feature film based on his 2020 short film Laura Hasn't Slept.Dr Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) starts to experience some frightening occurrences after witnessing a bizarre incident involving one of her patients. As she tries to make sense of what is happening, she must also confront her troubling past to survive and escape her horrifying new reality.Parker Finn has brought his own unique vision to the horror genre with SMILE. The film is a mix of genres, including psychological thriller, supernatural horror, and even dark comedy. It is an original and refreshing take on the genre that will keep you guessing until the very end.The acting in the film is top-notch, with Sosie Bacon delivering a tour-de-force performance as Dr Rose Cotter. She conveys the character's fear and confusion perfectly. The supporting cast is also excellent, with everyone playing their part convincingly.The cinematography is beautiful, and the film's use of colour is highly effective. The camera work is excellent, and the editing is tight. There are some truly horrifying moments in the film, which are made even more effective by the use of sound and music.SMILE is an accomplished debut film from Parker Finn. It is a well-crafted and original horror movie that is sure to please fans of the genre.

"A very gripping and beautiful horror movie. My only actual complaint is that i wish they kept Caitlin Stasey as the entity for a little longer for dialogue and confrontational scenes, it's no coincidence the marketing has her face all around, it's just too iconic. Kinda reminds me of Adelaide Wilson from Us, portrayed by the amazing actress Lupita Nyong'o, she proved that a superb acting mixed with a character with iconic attributes completely steals the show and simply makes the movie better, more thrilling. But i guess any word that would come out of the entity's mouth needed a logic and coherent dialogue, even if it is indeed just a lot of threats, they really kept a straight line there, a mindset, and i appreciate that. Still, in my opinion, a missed opportunity for this movie and the actress to shine even more.That said, the beggining of the movie is very very good. My only ""complaint"" would be the illogical uphand given to a 'disturbed' ( actually posessed ) person to commit suicide, but professionals are indeed human and slip sometimes, that could be solved with a bit more of paranormal elements displayed to the main character, making her reaction more plausible, you would buy the distraction even more. That said, i love shocking and intense starts in movies, it is a formula i'll never get tired of seeing. In fact, this movie has many formulas i deeply enjoy as an horror fan, which probably weirdly contradicts my minor issue with the Ring ( and probably others i missed ) references and inspirations, it is good. But originality does feels more than good and is more than welcome, and i'm aware we won't have another Rosemary's Baby any sooner or later, even tho we do have a very very good recent times horror movie : Hereditary. Thanks to a team of exceptional people.Regarding the characters : it is extremely close to The Ring, as soon as i saw the calm policeman slowly starting to believe, i surely knew his fate. He really reminded me of Noah with a subtle twist in his fate; he dies after the main character. The climax fight scene could be a little longer, just to make us believe that there would not be a plot twist, it just felt like it would, honestly since the movie does cares about it's quality and it is not a disappointment at all. Some shots are breathtaking and stylized even when they didn't need to be, which is not bad ( or perhaps, the upside down shot of a city meant the world felt like that, but i can't tell you such thing, i'll roll with a style choice, no complants ).I loved the entity's final appearence, it embodied the embodiment of Rose's trauma, very good. And as for the interpretations, some are common, which is not bad, just what the role required, no bad actors in scene, for example Jessie T. Usher delivered a very good skeptical and sometimes cynical character, it was on point and it wasn't much, just enough to deliver a beliavable character. That said, Sosie Bacon and Caitlin Stasey did a LOT, they were truly great. Even perfect at times, and this is coming from someone who holds Toni Collette at the top for horror interpretations. Any genre, actually. She was robbed of a win. Yeah, i didn't say nomination, she deserved a statue. Anyways, they delivered true suffering, huge props to them, amazing actresses.The pacing is good, at least during and after the opening scene. The first arc is great, the suicide, the entity creeping from the darkness and such, are great scenes. Anyways, there were a lot of ideas, concepts and points of view in this movie, they just needed more time to apply to it, that's why i would say this needed to be a six episode TV show, but then.. i do think some of the ideas were left aside on purpose due to it's possible huge complexity and plot holes to come, sometimes it's inevitable when you're not Agatha Christie.That said, we just need a badass believer in an horror movie, that exact entity may be fictional, but the world is a ""weird"" place all around, alike things do often happen and i definetly would be the first to believe her or at least give it a chance. Not everyone is skeptical, religion and such beliefs are a thing in our planet. And no, it doesn't needs to be the stereotype of the guy in the basement who is obsessed over aliens or ghosts and demons, make it be anyone else, it would be a breath of fresh air, but then i may be asking for a masterpiece.Final considerations :The ending reminded me a lot of one of The Ring's scene, not sure if it was a bonus or something ? Or perhaps a sequel. Where they show many people the cursed video at once, moving the curse ahead. It just instantly made me remember that.The creature's posession and interaction and CGI in the end was honestly Men ( another horror movie ) done right, that alone was a breath of fresh air.The ""curse not being over"" plot twist was also a very good callback to The Ring all over again, a cool sensation, thank you for that, you made me feel sorry for ""Noah"" again.I loved the giant skinny creepy monster, gave me a nostalgic feeling about Resident Evil and The Evil Within ( also that scene in Anabelle 2 )Joel really could have made a run for the matches before they were lit.This movie has style.Jokes aside... to not be completely unfair, the movie has very good moments of originality.Good ending, very brave.8/10.",gripping beautiful horror movie actual complaint wish kept caitlin stasey entity little longer dialogue confrontational scene coincidence marketing face around iconic kinda reminds adelaide wilson u portrayed amazing actress lupita nyong proved superb acting mixed character iconic attribute completely steal show simply make movie better thrilling guess word would come entity mouth needed logic coherent dialogue even indeed lot threat really kept straight line mindset appreciate still opinion missed opportunity movie actress shine even said beggining movie good complaint would illogical uphand given disturbed actually posessed person commit suicide professional indeed human slip sometimes could solved bit paranormal element displayed main character making reaction plausible would buy distraction even said love shocking intense start movie formula never get tired seeing fact movie many formula deeply enjoy horror fan probably weirdly contradicts minor issue ring probably others missed reference inspiration good originality feel good welcome aware another rosemary baby sooner later even tho good recent time horror movie hereditary thanks team exceptional people regarding character extremely close ring soon saw calm policeman slowly starting believe surely knew fate really reminded noah subtle twist fate dy main character climax fight scene could little longer make u believe would plot twist felt like would honestly since movie care quality disappointment shot breathtaking stylized even need bad perhaps upside shot city meant world felt like tell thing roll style choice complants loved entity final appearence embodied embodiment rose trauma good interpretation common bad role required bad actor scene example jessie usher delivered good skeptical sometimes cynical character point much enough deliver beliavable character said sosie bacon caitlin stasey lot truly great even perfect time coming someone hold toni collette top horror interpretation genre actually robbed win yeah say nomination deserved statue anyways delivered true suffering huge prop amazing actress pacing good least opening scene first arc great suicide entity creeping darkness great scene anyways lot idea concept point view movie needed time apply would say needed six episode tv show think idea left aside purpose due possible huge complexity plot hole come sometimes inevitable agatha christie said need badass believer horror movie exact entity may fictional world weird place around alike thing often happen definetly would first believe least give chance everyone skeptical religion belief thing planet need stereotype guy basement obsessed alien ghost demon make anyone else would breath fresh air may asking masterpiece final consideration ending reminded lot one ring scene sure bonus something perhaps sequel show many people cursed video moving curse ahead instantly made remember creature posession interaction cgi end honestly men another horror movie done right alone breath fresh air curse plot twist also good callback ring cool sensation thank made feel sorry noah loved giant skinny creepy monster gave nostalgic feeling resident evil evil within also scene anabelle joel really could made run match lit movie style joke aside completely unfair movie good moment originality good ending brave

"I think all the high ratings for this film are given by people who haven't seen the Ring. The story is completely stolen from that movie (which is already a remake of the Japanese original), except for the fact that they put it in a different context.In the ring, you watch a scary cursed tape and then the entity that cursed that tape will come after you and kill you, unless you pass the curse on to someone else. In smile, you watch a suicide and the entity that caused the suicide will come after you and kill you, unless you pass the curse on to someone else.The ring gets you at a psychological level and haunts you even after the movie is finished, and achieves that with using almost no jumpscares. Smile fails at that and knows it, so fills the entire length of the movie with nothing more than cheap jumpscares.I gave it a three and not a one because the concept of the ring is truly amazing and can be executed at a high and scary psychological level over and over again like, for example, it follows. But this movie just didn't get to that at any point.Long story short, save your time and money on this one and watch a movie like The Ring instead of you want to see a good horror film.",think high rating film given people seen ring story completely stolen movie already remake japanese original except fact put different context ring watch scary cursed tape entity cursed tape come kill unless pas curse someone else smile watch suicide entity caused suicide come kill unless pas curse someone else ring get psychological level haunt even movie finished achieves using almost jumpscares smile fails know fill entire length movie nothing cheap jumpscares gave three one concept ring truly amazing executed high scary psychological level like example follows movie get point long story short save time money one watch movie like ring instead want see good horror film
"I am insulted, personally, that any human thought this was an worthwhile or intriguing story to tell. Beyond being derivative and unoriginal, the film is thoroughly unconcerned with being entertaining. I love movies, even bad movies can teach you something - but, this movie makes me question the future of the art form. ""Be scare of...this person smiling."" It's not that I don't understand what you're trying to do, it's that it doesn't do it.Also aspects of the viral marketing campaign involved in publicizing the film are so annoying. It's a kind of horror story about a marketing campaign that invades other valid kinds of entertainment, merely to stand there with a dumb look on their face. I can't say why they think I'm supposed to be afraid of a smile, but they have managed to poison the world with that notion.",insulted personally human thought worthwhile intriguing story tell beyond derivative unoriginal film thoroughly unconcerned entertaining love movie even bad movie teach something movie make question future art form scare person smiling understand trying also aspect viral marketing campaign involved publicizing film annoying kind horror story marketing campaign invades valid kind entertainment merely stand dumb look face say think supposed afraid smile managed poison world notion
"I knew nothing about this coming in, aside from the fact that it's a horror movie. Prior to the movie starting, the writer and the main actor are thanking the crowd for coming to see their creation, which I thought was a nice touch. They did create something artistic and enjoyable complete with several jump scares that come just at the right moments.The movie rehashes an old concept, similar to what you can see in Fallen (1998) and The Conjuring (2013), which are both movies that I liked. It's not the scariest movie you'll see but it does include some gory images, easily earning the R rating. If you are considering going to the movie, I recommend you stop reading and just go see it.What took off some point for me was the ending. The movie is not very surprising, you can guess what's going on way before the characters do, since they apparently have not seen any stories about spirits. So, I was hoping the ending will be more effective, instead it is a confused set if events that is not really scary or shocking.Personally I would rather see a deeper fight between the demon and the main character (Rose), she has the right idea how to save herself from the demon (similar idea that was presented in ""Fallen"") and this was an opportunity to really make a deep impression on the audience, but they decided to use pyrotechnics instead of creating an impact through psychological effects, such as facing her guilt towards her mom and facing her own demos.Overall, not bad at all, just short of the 8 mark for me. Exact score: 74 / 100.",knew nothing coming aside fact horror movie prior movie starting writer main actor thanking crowd coming see creation thought nice touch create something artistic enjoyable complete several jump scare come right moment movie rehash old concept similar see fallen conjuring movie liked scariest movie see include gory image easily earning r rating considering going movie recommend stop reading go see took point ending movie surprising guess going way character since apparently seen story spirit hoping ending effective instead confused set event really scary shocking personally would rather see deeper fight demon main character rose right idea save demon similar idea presented fallen opportunity really make deep impression audience decided use pyrotechnic instead creating impact psychological effect facing guilt towards mom facing demo overall bad short mark exact score

One of the worst films l've ever seen. Not clever, terribly inaccurate in its portrayal of an emergency psychiatric ward and the acting is sooooo bad.

"I was hoping for a really innovative horror here, especially after a friend had seen it and said it scared the crap outta her.Aside from one less obvious jump scare I wasn't really frightened at any point. I think the movie does two things right and two wrong.The two right things are building tension slowly and creating a really nice aesthetic with clever camera work.The two wrong things were what broke it for me. Firstly, I couldn't get over seeing Kumar from Harold & Kumar / American Pie and take him seriously in a film of this nature. Casting fail.Secondly, using mental health as the thread for the storyline really diminishes the power of it for me as MH is real and very personal for people. Despite trying to hook the protagonists story into this by virtue of her job and her own struggles, it just felt wrong.Shame, as parts of this had promise but - as others have said - it dragged a bit in the middle and the ending was also disappointing.There's been better but there sure as hell has been worse.

"Smile is an entertaining horror movie that inadvertently squanders its entertaining concept with cheapening jump scares. It falls short of being great and drops itself into guilty pleasure territory.Dr. Rose Cotter, a therapist, takes a session with graduate student Laura Weaver who witnessed her art professor committing suicide. Laura claims to be plagued by a supernatural curse that passes between people, causing them to throw an eerie smile. Laura then smiles and commits suicide mid-session. Shortly after, Rose witness incidents of strangers smiling at her that have her questioning her reality...Smile evokes the lesson of ""Artists copy. Great artists steal."" Writer-director Parker Finn's horror concept draws bits and pieces from The Ring and It Follows but falls short of fulfilling the potential of his horror concept. While it is an intriguing concept, Finn over-relies on the same trick in the bag, the jump scare, which inadvertently breaks the unnerving tension of the smile.It fundamentally comes down to this: smiles are scary when they are held too long. One would start to question the intention behind the smile and begin to imagine sinister motives. Then, one questions everything around them.So why so many jack-in-the-box scares? I even caught onto the timing of the jump scares and after a few times, it wasn't scary anymore. I pointed at the screen as the loud sound and quick cut happened.The thing is, I loved the lore behind the smile and the metaphor therein when it was revealed. The film did a great job conveying the torture and claustrophobia of being cursed and not being able to explain it to anybody. There's potential for an improved sequel, if not a franchise.",smile entertaining horror movie inadvertently squanders entertaining concept cheapening jump scare fall short great drop guilty pleasure territory dr rose cotter therapist take session graduate student laura weaver witnessed art professor committing suicide laura claim plagued supernatural curse pass people causing throw eerie smile laura smile commits suicide mid session shortly rose witness incident stranger smiling questioning reality smile evokes lesson artist copy great artist steal writer director parker finn horror concept draw bit piece ring follows fall short fulfilling potential horror concept intriguing concept finn relies trick bag jump scare inadvertently break unnerving tension smile fundamentally come smile scary held long one would start question intention behind smile begin imagine sinister motif one question everything around many jack box scare even caught onto timing jump scare time scary anymore pointed screen loud sound quick cut happened thing loved lore behind smile metaphor therein revealed film great job conveying torture claustrophobia cursed able explain anybody potential improved sequel franchise
"Horror movie actors almost never get nominated for Oscars, but Sosie Bacon richly deserves recognition for her performance as the unraveling therapist in ""Smile."" One complaint I have about the movie is that the depictions of her trips into unreal worlds are basically dream sequences, a movie convention that I really hate because it fools you into thinking what's happening is real, then says, nope, it was all a dream. In this movie, she's not dreaming, but it's almost the same thing. Nonetheless, it's a good movie with a great lead performance and a terrific soundtrack amps up the tension at the right times.",horror movie actor almost never get nominated oscar sosie bacon richly deserves recognition performance unraveling therapist smile one complaint movie depiction trip unreal world basically dream sequence movie convention really hate fool thinking happening real say nope dream movie dreaming almost thing nonetheless good movie great lead performance terrific soundtrack amp tension right time

"It was an incredibly okay film. The cinematography, some parts of the score, and the often-compelling feeling of terror conveyed by the protagonist were worth staying for.The lack of development, of pacing, of any real substance in the writing (not that I was or usually do expect much of films like this in those departments) is what let it down. There were many opportunities to expand on the themes of trauma, of actually fleshing out more of the well-trodden cinematic concept (or even providing a little filler as the story went on) of the curse progressing.Not by any means the worst horror film I've seen, but one with enough potential within it to be somewhat disappointed by.",incredibly okay film cinematography part score often compelling feeling terror conveyed protagonist worth staying lack development pacing real substance writing usually expect much film like department let many opportunity expand theme trauma actually fleshing well trodden cinematic concept even providing little filler story went curse progressing mean worst horror film seen one enough potential within somewhat disappointed
"I got to know about Smile from various Social Media platforms and people rated it very high so went for it. It's basically discuss about mental health and yeah it's the whole plot. In this recent era a lot of peoples were talking about their depression and anxiety which is definitely good to discuss. Afterall discussion made it ease to digest this whole issue gradually. Anyways I don't wanna spoil a single thing about this movie because it can harm your horror psychological experience with this brilliant movie.From Acting POV :- Our main character did her job superbly here , she was perfectly casted for her role . The Cinematography, Cameraworks, BGMs,Jumpscares and Screenplay was Perfectly blended here in this entire storyline. Kudos to the director, he nailed his job with his perfect direction.The only thing which disappointed me regarding this movie is- It was quite predictable for sure ; I mean Ending Scary Cinematography was amazing to see but the Mystery part was totally missing in the Ending so Yeah! Not a Smiley ending for a horror genre lover.Apart from Jumpscares some Gory scenes also present here with clear self harm scenes so not suitable for weak hearted persons. But from my personal POV:- It didn't able to scare me! Yeah I got little bit scary experiences with jumpscares apart from that nothing visually scary for me. I will call it a good one time watch Psychological horror movie in recent time and my rating will be 6 outta 10 Stars for it.",got know smile various social medium platform people rated high went basically discus mental health yeah whole plot recent era lot people talking depression anxiety definitely good discus afterall discussion made ease digest whole issue gradually anyways wanna spoil single thing movie harm horror psychological experience brilliant movie acting pov main character job superbly perfectly casted role cinematography cameraworks bgms jumpscares screenplay perfectly blended entire storyline kudos director nailed job perfect direction thing disappointed regarding movie quite predictable sure mean ending scary cinematography amazing see mystery part totally missing ending yeah smiley ending horror genre lover apart jumpscares gory scene also present clear self harm scene suitable weak hearted person personal pov able scare yeah got little bit scary experience jumpscares apart nothing visually scary call good one time watch psychological horror movie recent time rating outta star
"It was more of a loud noise that was the ""scare"" vs an actual scare. Very predictable. I feel like the ""trauma entity"" could've been way more scary. It wasn't absolutely terrible. I just expected much more from it than what I got. I'm not a fan that it killed ol Mustache either. (When you watch you'll understand this reference)..I'm not mad I watched it but it's something I'll probably never watch again, even if a sequel happens. It's one of those movies that can only go over the same thing so many times. Me personally, I had it figured out within 30 minutes into the movie. Like I said not absolutely terrible but could've done a lot more with ""tweaking""..",loud noise scare v actual scare predictable feel like trauma entity could way scary absolutely terrible expected much got fan killed ol mustache either watch understand reference mad watched something probably never watch even sequel happens one movie go thing many time personally figured within minute movie like said absolutely terrible could done lot tweaking
"I'm actually feeling like this is a 6.5 stars, but if I have to pick between 6 and 7, it edges over to 7. It has one of the uneasiest opening sequences of any horror movie I've seen recently, and that uneasiness carries through as the film comes back to that sequence repeatedly throughout. However, it's hard to ignore that the story beats are pretty much beat for beat The Ring. If you're going to crib from a horror movie, crib from the masters, and this one is very well produced and acted. Sosie Bacon is great as Dr. Rose Cotter, the psychiatrist who slowly unravels as a supernatural creature picks apart her PTSD for its own sustenance. The special effects are very convincing and so is Rose's escalating panic as she realizes that nobody is going to believe her any more than she believed Laura Weaver when she stumbled into her office. This has a lot of tense scenes and well crafted jump scares, and yet I'm not sure if I want to watch it again because there are no real surprises in the plot. I can definitely recommend watching it at least once though.",actually feeling like star pick edge one uneasiest opening sequence horror movie seen recently uneasiness carry film come back sequence repeatedly throughout however hard ignore story beat pretty much beat beat ring going crib horror movie crib master one well produced acted sosie bacon great dr rose cotter psychiatrist slowly unravels supernatural creature pick apart ptsd sustenance special effect convincing rose escalating panic realizes nobody going believe believed laura weaver stumbled office lot tense scene well crafted jump scare yet sure want watch real surprise plot definitely recommend watching least though
"Every now and then it seems that you can feel when a film is going wrong. This is one of them.It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.The makers, knew they had a good idea, that's why they spent so much on the advertising at baseball games etc. It was also that style of marketing at those games that made me want to watch it. It screamed ""something new"".However, it seems the marketing department would have done a better job at directing this film based on their stunts. I'll always remember those stunts as being great and actually ""getting under my skin"" enough to watch the film but also that they mislead me.For the actual film, the ""scary moments"", involving the titular ""Smile"" are so few and far between that it just isn't interesting or scary. There aren't really enough crowds or random people in the movie for it to make sense. I expected to see the ""Smile"" everywhere(but also still randomly/with tension) but its probably less than 5 times and in completely obvious places.Its mostly the main character battling her past, her present and her job. This could be a good movie by itself. But no supernatural smiling thing yay.If you want a film that has the same sort of idea, go back and watch It Follows, it has more punch and more plot and more scares.If I had to guess, I'd say the team behind this either got lost and wound up in their idea or they left the good parts of the film on the cutting room floor.",every seems feel film going wrong one like watching train wreck slow motion maker knew good idea spent much advertising baseball game etc also style marketing game made want watch screamed something new however seems marketing department would done better job directing film based stunt always remember stunt great actually getting skin enough watch film also mislead actual film scary moment involving titular smile far interesting scary really enough crowd random people movie make sense expected see smile everywhere also still randomly tension probably le time completely obvious place mostly main character battling past present job could good movie supernatural smiling thing yay want film sort idea go back watch follows punch plot scare guess say team behind either got lost wound idea left good part film cutting room floor
"In my opinion, the idea was very good, and the movie started out excellent in terms of excitement, terror, and panic, and this rhythm continued until half of the movie.But the second half of the film turned into a normal performance and mostly expected events. Therefore, in the second half, almost all of the momentum and the excellent Build-Up process on which the film began was lost.I recommend watching the movie, but don't expect much in the second half.

"This reminded me so much of It Follows. It's the same 'death is creeping and coming to find you' kind a thing.That being said, Smile is really well made. The direction is excellent, it has a really creepy feel throughout but the best thing is wonderful sound design and sound editing.There are also some problems. The plot takes Rose into a manic state a bit too quickly for my liking, I realise she has just seen someone kill themselves but still, she is a psychiatrist. Also the ending could have done more than the 'it was all a dream' fake out. Something that that was overused overall.Other than that quite recommended.",reminded much follows death creeping coming find kind thing said smile really well made direction excellent really creepy feel throughout best thing wonderful sound design sound editing also problem plot take rose manic state bit quickly liking realise seen someone kill still psychiatrist also ending could done dream fake something overused overall quite recommended
"This movie should be called ""Random"". The story and characters are random, generic and just flat and boring. It's nothing you couldn't see in 40 other generic horror titles. You don't really have a chance to meet any of the characters deeply and they all feel like a generic piece-of-paper script, nothing three dimensional or alive or credible. Just meh. The story is just a random chain of events, most characters and scenes appear there for no reason as they do not introduce anything new to the story not create any tension. The movie starts pretty promising, first 20 minutes, then it's just boring, predictable and dropping. Long story short, I'm very disillusioned. I was hoping to see a anxiety-driven claustrophobic horror, this was your generic hollywood-whatever money maker.

"I'm beginning to believe the whole ""film producers use bots to boost reviews"" theory, because Smile was not nearly as good as the reviews would have you think. The opening scene is admittedly pretty good. Well acted, and the protagonist, Rose, acts exactly how you would expect someone to act in her situation, which is a nice surprise in the horror genre. But the plot the movie follows is sadly shallow, predictable, and similar to many movies like ""The Ring"" or ""It Follows"". Sometimes a movie can still be scary despite this, but Smile is certainly not one of them. Nearly every scare is a cheap jumpscare. With all these things combined, the movie fails to deliver on each genre it's listed as. Horror, mystery, thriller, each poorly executed. All these flaws lead up to a disappointing climax. Like most modern horror films, ""Barbarian"" comes to mind here, the writers just cannot figure out how to end a horror movie to save their lives. While the very last scene is good, the way they get to it in those 15 final minutes is frankly abysmal. I want to avoid spoilers in my review, so I won't go into any detail. Just know that the writers fail on providing a compelling climax in this film. I give it a 3/10 because it is well shot, the actors are pretty good and the effects are alright. That doesn't make up for the obvious issues present in most of the film, however.

"I expected 'Truth or Dare' vibes but was pleasantly impressed that Smile showcased a disturbingly trippy plot. 'Smile' was enjoyable because I felt every emotion and craziness the main character 'Rose' experienced and the killings. We like gruesome, scary killing! It is #spookyszn. Also, the movie balanced the thrill, the kill, and the comedy appeal.Focusing on the theme of the characters facing trauma-induced triggers and displaying the perspective of those who are mentally ill made the movie that much more enjoyable!I liked this movie; I suggest you watch this in theaters!

"This movie was a mixture of It Follows and The Ring, and where it lacked in originality, it made up for in its horrifying imagery and concepts. What scared me most about this movie was the fact that Rose was never safe no matter where she went. The idea that you can't trust anybody, including the people you feel safest around gave me the creeps. The jump-scares and unnerving soundtrack were excellent, and the ending had some very disturbing imagery. I personally didn't mind the fact that it wasn't a brand new concept. It was a movie that genuinely scared me, and put its own original spin on existing horror plots. I don't think a horror movie has to redefine the genre to be good, and Smile was very well executed overall.",movie mixture follows ring lacked originality made horrifying imagery concept scared movie fact rose never safe matter went idea trust anybody including people feel safest around gave creep jump scare unnerving soundtrack excellent ending disturbing imagery personally mind fact brand new concept movie genuinely scared put original spin existing horror plot think horror movie redefine genre good smile well executed overall
"Smile is a movie that begins its session by giving you a small acid trip. Right off the bat, it sets the stage for you in a way where you would want to sit back and let it all unfold piece by piece. As the plot continues and the story moves forward from start to finish, things start to get a little slow in some places. In between the first and the last act sometimes you would want to skip forward and see the conclusion but at the same time, you would want to enjoy what's unfolding at the current moment. Director Parker Finn has made a harmony that balances between making the audience hungry and filling them in the next moment, and in that the screenplay, editing especially acting played a big role. The actors have done quite a good job of making you feel the raw emotions coming out of the screen. All in all, Smile gives you a good enough dose of horror packed with thrill to keep you seated on the chair.",smile movie begin session giving small acid trip right bat set stage way would want sit back let unfold piece piece plot continues story move forward start finish thing start get little slow place first last act sometimes would want skip forward see conclusion time would want enjoy unfolding current moment director parker finn made harmony balance making audience hungry filling next moment screenplay editing especially acting played big role actor done quite good job making feel raw emotion coming screen smile give good enough dose horror packed thrill keep seated chair

"This is a quality horror, production. The biggest drawback is that it's predictable for those who horror ""enthusiasts."" That said, there are a few well-timed diversions or twists. Some of the.scares are effective and still have a surprise factor. At least one of the better ""scares"" are revealed in the promotional ads for it, so hopefully you haven't seen certain ones. One of the negatives is that the main character is smart, and pretty quickly catches the pattern but she, but is slow to act. Also when she's looking for someone to tell her truth too, she suddenly becomes inarticulate, which reinforces image as a therapist who's undergoing an emotional crisis/breakdown. Overall, it's an entertaining yarn and almost certainly too traumatic/ scary for children.",quality horror production biggest drawback predictable horror enthusiast said well timed diversion twist scare effective still surprise factor least one better scare revealed promotional ad hopefully seen certain one one negative main character smart pretty quickly catch pattern slow act also looking someone tell truth suddenly becomes inarticulate reinforces image therapist undergoing emotional crisis breakdown overall entertaining yarn almost certainly traumatic scary child
"I got intrigued with this movie after the stellar publicity stunt the movie makers did with the actors staging themselves at baseball games with the creepy smiles and such. And the stunt they pulled with the lady in the window at the Today Show. Whoever came up with these ideas for promoting the film should get a cut of the major profits they made ($17 mil budget, box office made over $200 mil!!!) So I decided to wait until it was free just in case it was a below average movie. The first third of the film set everything up nicely. The middle third was just your run of the mill spooks and mystery. The last third was a bit more intriguing and I am happy to report its not your typical ""everything works out in the end"" Hollywood movie. The acting is good, cinematography good, jumps scares are just okay. Not too gory. Probably best parts of movie area in the trailer. I think it's worth a watch for people who like movies in the genre of ""It Follows,"" ""Truth or Dare,"" and other small budget entity possession type movies. But it's a one and done for me.",got intrigued movie stellar publicity stunt movie maker actor staging baseball game creepy smile stunt pulled lady window today show whoever came idea promoting film get cut major profit made mil budget box office made mil decided wait free case average movie first third film set everything nicely middle third run mill spook mystery last third bit intriguing happy report typical everything work end hollywood movie acting good cinematography good jump scare okay gory probably best part movie area trailer think worth watch people like movie genre follows truth dare small budget entity possession type movie one done
"I genuinely was so excited for this film. The release date was saved on my calendar and the days were being counted down. I had been speaking about it about for months and begging all my friends to join me when I bought the tickets to watch it. Ultimately, it was a let down. You could see the ending a mile away and not enough was left to the imagination. Would have been so much better with an ending that leaves you guessing, not a corny beast.

The complexity of generational trauma or hereditary mental illness would have been a great way to leave this entity as metaphorical, but instead it was very much physical and cheesy.",genuinely excited film release date saved calendar day counted speaking month begging friend join bought ticket watch ultimately let could see ending mile away enough left imagination would much better ending leaf guessing corny beast film biggest downfall horror psychological thriller complexity generational trauma hereditary mental illness would great way leave entity metaphorical instead much physical cheesy
"There are so many details in this movie in regards to the psych ward and mental health practices/laws that are just wrong.

Example 2: When the smiling man on the bed was restrained on the floor. Yahh that wouldn't happen either. The second example isn't as obvious to people who aren't aware of mental health practices but the first example should be obvious to most people especially a screenwriter.The first 23 minutes is mostly filler, around 40 min it gets good!Also how Parker Finn directs the characters to interact with each other is unrealistic and odd.The movie feels like it was a made by a professional but a bunch of armature mistakes were made.",many detail movie regard psych ward mental health practice law wrong example corded phone wall glass vase interview room neither thing would ever interview room anyplace patient access example smiling man bed restrained floor yahh happen either second example obvious people aware mental health practice first example obvious people especially screenwriter first minute mostly filler around min get good also parker finn directs character interact unrealistic odd movie feel like made professional bunch armature mistake made

"The premis is pretty much the same as ""It Fallows"". The main character sees an entity that haunts her with a creepy smile and appears everywhere. This movie is a bit better in my opinion. It's a lot more psychological and less horny teens passing on an STD ghost. That being said, it is by no means a masterpiece. It's also a little inconsistent with the atmosphere. It's slow with creepy scenes randomly throughout. The ending wasn't very satisfying either. It has a lot of your typical ghost story elements. Creepy, unexplained events happen to the protagonist and she doesn't believe at first. Then it excalates to her going crazy and no body believes her except one person that she wouldn't ordinarily turn to. On top that there is the ""one survivor"". The only one person who managed to survive it to whom she tries to talk too but he gives her little help.

"It was entertaining, although really nothing new. The whole creepy smile works for me, as I've always found that sort of contrasting image of psychotic danger with a big, maniacal grin on its face to be terrifying. The jumpscares weren't done to death, and fit the storyline, rather than coming out of nowhere just to make you, well, jump. But as I watched this in my living room, I was able to say out loud to myself, ""okay, this is whats happening next..."" and get it right most of the time. So yes, it was very predictable, and much of the plot content has been done before. Everyone has been comparing this movie to ""It Follows,"" and with good reason. It uses a lot of the same ideas, but it stops short of outright plagiarism. However, consider that after over 100 years of movies being made, it's impossible to not see the same concepts used over and over again - eventually. The obvious influences of other horror films are readily apparent, but that doesn't kill the movie. Have to say the big spooky thing at the end was kind of a letdown, and the plot resolution was very disappointing. Anyway, it doesn't break new ground - not really - but it's pretty well done for what it is. I'd recommend it. And not for nothing, but the actress in the lead role needs to eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every now and then - she looked like a wraith. Just saying.",entertaining although really nothing new whole creepy smile work always found sort contrasting image psychotic danger big maniacal grin face terrifying jumpscares done death fit storyline rather coming nowhere make well jump watched living room able say loud okay whats happening next get right time yes predictable much plot content done everyone comparing movie follows good reason us lot idea stop short outright plagiarism however consider year movie made impossible see concept used eventually obvious influence horror film readily apparent kill movie say big spooky thing end kind letdown plot resolution disappointing anyway break new ground really pretty well done recommend nothing actress lead role need eat pint ben jerry every looked like wraith saying
"Smile is this year's It Follows, a sleeper hit among younger audiences who mistake rote horror cliches for suspense and depth. Its twists can be seen from a mile away and the jump scares are as predictable and ineffective as they come. Like the aforementioned movie, Smile revolves around an entity that, following a cathartic event in the opening scene, starts to pursuit the main character who is dealing with issues all their own. It's a slow burn that frequently lulls the viewer into apathy, and the often uninspired direction doesn't help things either. As the movie drags towards the end with a surprisingly resonant and graphic resolution, its heavy handed handling of themes such as trauma and grief becomes all the more obvious. By the end of 2023, this movie will no doubt have been replaced by the next ""big thing"" - and hopefully more memorable than this one.",smile year follows sleeper hit among younger audience mistake rote horror cliche suspense depth twist seen mile away jump scare predictable ineffective come like aforementioned movie smile revolves around entity following cathartic event opening scene start pursuit main character dealing issue slow burn frequently lull viewer apathy often uninspired direction help thing either movie drag towards end surprisingly resonant graphic resolution heavy handed handling theme trauma grief becomes obvious end movie doubt replaced next big thing hopefully memorable one
"This film like any has positives and negatives.Positives:
-good use of jump scares, disturbing images, creepy music, etc to set the tone
-story is a great allegory for ptsd and dealing with trauma. Much like the ending, you can work through your traumas but they'll always be with you to some extent. I do feel like the twist ending shows this but also takes it a bit far in that trauma doesn't always destroy you or others around you if dealt with continually and always being aware of it. Also does a good job at highlighting commonness of mental illness in society, the stigma of mental illness in society and the isolation that causes in people getting help (even for those in the mental health field).-an overall good psychological thriller, as others noted similar to the ring which used to be my favorite horror movie so i like the similarities. Id also compare it to the visit..in regard to style, which is one of my other favorites.Cons:
-my first annoyance came while trying to watch this movie with a house of sleeping people. The volume of normal speech in the movie is very quiet compared to the jump scene volumes. I know this is a normal strategy but it was more exaggerated than normal. To not disturb my household I had to repeatedly change the volume to be able to hear the dialogue and not disturb my sleeping kids at the same time.. That being said, as another con this movie is highly predictable and I quickly figured out based on cues when to turn it down. Would've been nice if they didn't rely as much on jumps and volume changes though.-acting is mediocre at best, especially with the main character and her role as a therapist and understanding of the mental health system and her options for help were poor at best. The fiance was also dull and lacked depth and skill. Most the actors were just okay.Overall, the cons are just minor annoyances and the film was one of the better horror movies I've seen in awhile.

"If you like jump scares don't miss this movie. There were several times that I shook the entire leg bar at the theatre from jumping and at one point I even yelped from one. It has some classic horror movie cliches, which I'm not usually a fan of, but this movie needed breaks from the intensity and it all worked beautifully. Lovely cinematography and direction, and Sosie Bacon gave an all around incredible performance.This movie made my inner child afraid and no movie has made me feel like that in a very long time.

"Sprinkle a little bit of ""The Ring"" with a dash of ""It Follows"", and let it sit and fester in the warm sun for a few days and you'll get this cinematic piece of junk. A tired and overdone ""pass this on or you'll DIE!!!"" just like the chain-letter emails that your grandma sends you with the ""RE:RE:RE:RE:RE:RE:RE:RE"" subject lines.It's not scary or really that interesting of a movie, with the ""scares"" boiling down to nothing but a few jump scares. It plods along getting more and more predictable with each painstakingly mind-numbing minute.What we have here is yet another long and drawn out yawnfest. Bad wrting and lack of any real story or plot, so the film gets padded with unrelated and unnecessary fluff.The ""story"" could have easily been told (and more effectively, I'd add) in a 30 minute short film... but it would still be a hack job ripoff of things that have already been done.Hollywood ""writers""...

I was already terrified with the first Smile encounter with Laura and the way they continued that throughout the whole movie was really good.

"Surprisingly good psychological horror that's heavily inspired by It Follows-with an extra helping of madness similar to Malignant. Some really good gore effects that don't rely solely on CGI too! It separates itself from the typical Blumhouse affair by treating the audience like adults, not idiots.The tense story is very light on exposition, information is implied, and character arcs occur naturally. With an abundance of drone shots of the city and dim color grading, they create a cold concrete atmosphere. Paired with the creepy soundtrack, another piece borrowed from It Follows, there's enough tension that the non-stop jump scares felt unnecessary. Although frightening, some of the scares blur the line between taking inspiration and borderline plagiarism. The Ring's infamous scenes were most frequently recycled.The main character's descent into madness is the most engaging part of the film because of how it puts you in her perspective. Even when the script gets a little too serious, the lead actress delivers an exceptional performance. The film's ultimate message about mental illness, trauma, and suicide was forgone in favor of a cool final set piece. Though the ending didn't tease a sequel, it leaves a few untied loose ends.This is fantastic psychological horror for the first 10 minutes then terrifying cosmic horror for about the last 25 minutes. But there's an hour of predictable jump scares and tired tropes in between that have been done hundreds of times since the inception of the genre. Most annoying of all, the stupid character decisions become more apparent each time you watch it. If only they could've maintained that mind bending throughout the whole runtime it'd be an 8/10.",surprisingly good psychological horror heavily inspired follows extra helping madness similar malignant really good gore effect rely solely cgi separate typical blumhouse affair treating audience like adult idiot tense story light exposition information implied character arc occur naturally abundance drone shot city dim color grading create cold concrete atmosphere paired creepy soundtrack another piece borrowed follows enough tension non stop jump scare felt unnecessary although frightening scare blur line taking inspiration borderline plagiarism ring infamous scene frequently recycled main character descent madness engaging part film put perspective even script get little serious lead actress delivers exceptional performance film ultimate message mental illness trauma suicide forgone favor cool final set piece though ending tease sequel leaf untied loose end fantastic psychological horror first minute terrifying cosmic horror last minute hour predictable jump scare tired trope done hundred time since inception genre annoying stupid character decision become apparent time watch could maintained mind bending throughout whole runtime
"So the main character is a therapist who has a traumatic past (guilt over the death of her mother, whose dying pleas for 10-year-old her to call 911 she ignored) and it has ruled her relationships throughout her life. Her sister is in complete denial and so their relationship is strained, she dumped her former boyfriend when she felt she was getting too close to him and her current fiance is kept at arm's length, even proving himself to be untrustworthy with her deeper emotions.She witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman who had also just witnessed a gruesome suicide. Then she (the therapist) begins to see awful visions and hear things. Of course the ""mental health professional goes crazy"" trope is a familiar one, but this is done in a way that seems intentionally trope-ish. After all, everything in the film is seen through her distrust of everyone (including herself) and the trauma that she experienced as a 10-year-old....so it makes sense that some of the things she experiences are a bit cartoony. It really works.Well she figures out that in order to beat the monster, she has to kill someone with a witness in order to pass on the curse of being haunted by it (although she would then still not be free, spending the rest of her days in prison). But she gets the brilliant idea to confront her demons instead, driving to the derelict house where her mother died. She literally confronts her past and kills the monster by setting it on fire, and the house with it. She drives back to ex-bf's house and fesses up to her feelings. It seems like all is going to be okay....
And that's when this movie seriously screws the pooch.Because ex-bf turns into the monster and attacks her. She runs out of his apartment but OPE! It's actually the house! She never escaped! And now ex-bf has come to save the day, just in time for her to suddenly, with no explanation, stop fighting and allow the monster to climb inside her body. So she sets herself on fire (of course with the creepy grin all victims wear) and the curse is passed on to him.I have so many problems with this. My two biggest complaints are that the sudden switch and her completely unprovoked surrender were NOT earned. Nothing previous and nothing after indicated why this sudden shift. Instead of being a story about a woman battling her own mind told through the lens of cosmic horror, it became cosmic horror that manipulated a ""trending topic"" into a monster story with no inherent value other than shock and grotesquerie.Even more troubling than that: the movie has beautiful symbolism and allegory with the current state of mental health facilities and services, and really shows mental illness in a way that feels raw but respectful. I drew many parallels to my own struggles with mental health and was truly rooting for her to maybe not completely overcome the monster, but find a way to exist in spite of its presence. I am not usually a fan of happy endings in horror- I don't expect it and it usually feels very forced- but in this case, I wanted to see some ray of hope. That's where the story was pointed. That's where the main character took it.So you can see why, when she all of a sudden allowed this thing to replace her in body and mind, destroying her in every sense of the word, it didn't track and I was stunned. The movie was so full of fake-outs that I expected it to be another one. I had to process for several minutes when the credits rolled to even understand the emotions I was feeling. Anger! Insult! Betrayal! Disgust!For a movie that spent 95% of its runtime showing someone fighting for their life, their sanity, and the trust and help of their loved ones to spend the last ten minutes throwing that out the window felt like I could only take away one message:
""You will never win against your demons. Even when you think you've made progress, they will come back. So you might as well give up and end it all now.""

"With its over the top advertising campaign I knew from hey start they were putting way too much effort into shoving the idea of this movie into potential viewers eyes. Terrible CGI can be forgiven, but even a stuffed animal is better than what they tried to do. The best actor is Kal Penn of course but he's barely in it. It's taken me over a week to get through this movie because of how genuinely weak the story and acting are. This is as much a horror movie as much as Halloween Kills was. Nothing in this movie is genuinely scary or horrifying in the least, gory? Sure just a little bit. But believable? Not at all. The high praise this movie is getting must be coming from ""my first scary movie viewers"" because wow.

"This film keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the entire way through. The sound design and score are very well developed, creating a seamless experience of suspense and terror. The visual aesthetics provide a horrifically delightful element that corresponds with the performances of Sosie Bacon and the rest of the cast, inside the world within the story. Parker Finn's shot selection was successfully executed, drawing the audience into an uncomfortable intimate understanding of what the characters are experiencing. ""Smile"" is worth going to theaters to experience in the best way possible.

"There are lots of so scary movies out there that are not really scary. It only gives you gory scenes, monsters and so on.However, this movie really did the basic of scary movie which are pop up things, and sound. Without them, they will not be scary at all.The content of the is movie, is okay, but somehow it drags too long in the middle and at the end.All scary movies have one thing in common, they are about killings or death whether they come from monsters or evil spirit or individuals. Movies like Scream, Friday the 13th, etc are exaggeration of a human being. When I watched those films, the producers emphasized the invulnerability of the a villain.Where at this movie, the villain at first made me think it the victim, but actually it is ... better not say it at this time. But the whole thing of Smile is not just about killing, it is about evil, curse, and mental problems involved. It is a good movie as a horror movie. You will be shocked with few scene.

"This could have been something diffrent but nooo. Just another scary movie without any real scares.Not to say it had its moments but it was so slow and sometimes nothing really happned, thats ok if they got the atmosphere to support it. This film did not.My girlfriend fell asleep, that is a bad sign. As for myself i was hoping they would do something else. Something new or a twist or something other than what did happen.Story goes that a evil ""thing"" haunts people and make them commit sucide infront of a victim then it starts to haunt the victim until they commit sucide in front of another victim and on it goes. But it needs someone to see the sucide. It does this by taking over the victim and kills it while smiling, like slit its own throat or something. You can break the chain by killing someone instead.At the end the girls love intrest or ex or something who knows all this comes to the house she is hiding in, becouse if no one is near the spirit or whatever it is wont take her over and kill her.He comes in, she has just drenched herself in gasoline and stands there smiling, the slowly lights a match and he just stand there like a moron.He is a cop and could have tackled her before she lit the match he had plenty of time. He watched her burn and the end, what a waste.And the girl acted like a real moron at times.

"Had a few decent jump scares and was creepier and better than the rest of the horror movies I've seen lately, but honestly the ending was rushed, lazy and poorly done and could have been architectured into something much better, so because of the ending I found the film rather disappointing. I think they could have done so much better with that.And why do they always have to kill the family pet in these movies?? There's really no cause for that! I think it makes the film tasteless, I mean it's fine if the humans die but animals dying in movies is upsetting, and everyone feels that way. Why kill the poor cat? So I give this movie an average rating, I wouldn't watch it again, it wasn't awful but it wasn't great.",decent jump scare creepier better rest horror movie seen lately honestly ending rushed lazy poorly done could architectured something much better ending found film rather disappointing think could done much better always kill family pet movie really cause think make film tasteless mean fine human die animal dying movie upsetting everyone feel way kill poor cat give movie average rating watch awful great

"When it comes to modern horror movies that operate on the ""Ooooh, spooky thing is going to get you"" sort of storyline, I try to keep my expectations low. Polaroid and the Bye Bye Man are great examples of BAD movies with this plot, and Smile surprised me by being one of the better renditions.I really enjoyed the premise that the protagonist got to witness the ""scary thing"" and hear about someone's experience with it before she herself was affected. I'm so bored of characters finding an old doodad that accidentally kills a few friends of theirs... skipping that learning phase really helped with the pacing of this movie. And the monster reveal? Super creepy, loved it.That being said, I still felt like this movie was a big slow, and definitely relied heavily on common tropes of horror.

Tell me what you think!Anyway, I actually liked the movie. It is entertaining, and quite disturbing, yet not to the point of not letting you sleep at night. One might say that it is not as disturbing as horror movies are usually expected to be.Anyway, one thing I really wanted to point out is that we did not have answers... Where did this thing originally come from? What even is this thing? What does it want? What actually happened in the end? Is the thing gone, or was it transferred to joel? (I am not a huge fan of the ending either way).Overall, the movie is well done. While some ideas were just recycled from other horror movies, the concept itself is rather original (the idea of creepy smiling people everywhere).Jumpscare moments were just unbelievable! We could literally hear people screaming in the movies! There were so many that at some point I was thinking, ""my heart cannot handle this anymore."" I am not complaining though.

"There is such a mixed bag of horror out there today it's refreshing to get something with a little bit of potency. The main character's downward spiral is well done. I agree with the comparisons to The Ring and It Follows. Although Smile has an air of familiarity about it, it also has enough unique surprises to keep things fresh. There are plenty of ""jump scares"", but really only one or two that you don't see coming - these were well executed. Kudos for the ending. It has one of the better and more disturbing creature effects I've scene in a while, and the reality bending was disorienting without being disengaging, helping to ratchet up the tension.",mixed bag horror today refreshing get something little bit potency main character downward spiral well done agree comparison ring follows although smile air familiarity also enough unique surprise keep thing fresh plenty jump scare really one two see coming well executed kudos ending one better disturbing creature effect scene reality bending disorienting without disengaging helping ratchet tension

"It has a similar premise of a curse being passed from person to person. Although, in this movie, it is a lot more urgent and threatening.I appreciated that movie didn't solely rely on jump-scares, although there may have been a few too many.One gripe I have is that the monster at the end looks laughable, and it somewhat ruins immersion. If they didn't have a budget to do it properly, they shouldn't have included it in the movie - IMO, the ending would have been a lot more effective without it.All in all - I enjoyed it.

You need to understand, the only movies I watch, all the time, all my life, are horror and murder documentary..that's it.This movie broke me.I'm sure that my fear of disfigured faces played a huge part in this cause I absolutely couldn't look at them smiling..
But other that that this movie has got huge build ups and scary ""pop up"" figures every 2 minutes..so that's good and bad editing, cause they count on the jump scares..

"For context: I am personally a fan of slasher/supernatural horror. Psychological horror tends to be more frightening to me. The concept that the main character is enduring a very real psychosis is actually pretty frightening. The concept that every time you turn the corner, someone is smiling at you almost as if they are the hunter and you are the prey is terrifying. The idea that this is also almost a virus and that it's an inescapable fate that not even our protagonist will defeat is horrifying. I liked the concept and didn't entirely dislike the execution. I actually thought it was pretty scary. But my issue is the number of times it has to lean into cheap jump scares of music stings to frighten the viewer when the concept itself is frightening. The cheapness of the scares and stings doesn't seem to fit the genre well for me. Psych horror to me feels like it should rely on the plot and acting to make the viewer uneasy, the use of stings and scares constantly feels like I'm watching a straight cheap horror.",context personally fan slasher supernatural horror psychological horror tends frightening concept main character enduring real psychosis actually pretty frightening concept every time turn corner someone smiling almost hunter prey terrifying idea also almost virus inescapable fate even protagonist defeat horrifying liked concept entirely dislike execution actually thought pretty scary issue number time lean cheap jump scare music sting frighten viewer concept frightening cheapness scare sting seem fit genre well psych horror feel like rely plot acting make viewer uneasy use sting scare constantly feel like watching straight cheap horror

"I feel like the Director watched 'It follows' and 'Drag me to Hell' and then mashed them together and made this movie. Sosie Bacon did a great job, very Believably traumatized performance. Kyle Gallner was a Simp in the line of duty. It's hard for me to believe that Kal Penn would sign on for this movie. There were a few good scenes and some tense moments mixed in with a few jump scares and the sound effects were great. But this movie deflated with a silly Syfy channel CGI climax with an ending I saw coming from a mile away. I really wanted to like it but at the end of the day it was just another throw away horror movie.",feel like director watched follows drag hell mashed together made movie sosie bacon great job believably traumatized performance kyle gallner simp line duty hard believe kal penn would sign movie good scene tense moment mixed jump scare sound effect great movie deflated silly syfy channel cgi climax ending saw coming mile away really wanted like end day another throw away horror movie
"I didn't mind this movie, I went to see it with a friend and we had a good scare. Although wasn't very original; reminds me of that movie 'truth or dare' with that girl from Pretty little liars. Or 'It Follows'. Which I somewhat enjoyed. The ending was also quite predictable and didn't do the rest of the movie justice. The main actress was amazing and I loved her performance so kudos to her. The supporting actors were also not bad. The jump scares in this movie were great and had me hiding behind my hands a few times. But alas, you can't rely on a few scares to make your movie work. The plot was enjoyable as well, but you can't look too far deep into the meaning and lore, because it will just get confusing and you'll find plot holes and weird takes on the whole 'trauma' aspect.

"After hearing much buzz about Smile, I was eager to finally check it out. Starting off in an unsettling manner, I quickly felt a let down as the cursed Smilers work against horror, as the deaths are gory, but fearless. With not one scream or sign of discomfort, it leaves all the terror to the jump scares, which does not produce long lasting fear. While the smiles are a bit creepy, they are just normal people smiles and do not do enough of an interesting job to look memorable or truly scary. The acting is mostly fine, but there are some moments that feel flat and ridiculous, given the performances. The story is very basic, slightly predictable, and might have greatly benefitted from this being a creepy short film instead. Unfortunately, the film did nothing interesting or fun with the idea and basically copies the formula of films such as It Follows or The Ring, but not nearly as well done.",hearing much buzz smile eager finally check starting unsettling manner quickly felt let cursed smiler work horror death gory fearless one scream sign discomfort leaf terror jump scare produce long lasting fear smile bit creepy normal people smile enough interesting job look memorable truly scary acting mostly fine moment feel flat ridiculous given performance story basic slightly predictable might greatly benefitted creepy short film instead unfortunately film nothing interesting fun idea basically copy formula film follows ring nearly well done
"A weak, weak movie. Pointless.Elements of 'It Follows', 'The Ring', and 'The Babadook'A mixture of the aforementioned movies should make for a good, strong horror movie. Alas, Smile is unoriginal, with a few jump scenes, a couple of gory bits, and twists you can see coming a mile off.I'd heard stories of people passing out watching this. That had me intrigued. The start is well worked and heightened my intrigue. As the movie goes on, the script plays out, and the movie gets weaker and weaker. The twists became apparent before they 'twisted'. The end was poo. Just like the end of this review.** I purposely ended this review stupidly and disappointingly, because this movie is just that - stupid and disappointing!

"Most of the movie is a watchable psychological thriller. Keeps the viewer wondering what is going on - - is it all in her head? Is it an entity? Is she going mad?It's not the greatest thing ever, but it is intriguing enough to keep you engaged, despite some slow and inconsistent spots.But then... completely ruined by an idiotic, nonsensical, meaningless ending. The problem isn't just that they didn't resolve anything - it would've been OK to leave some questions hanging, as long as the essentials were dealt with. That's acceptable for a scary movie.Unfortunately, though, it abruptly becomes an entirely different genre at the end because they obviously had no idea what else to do with it. I can't say too much without putting a ""spoiler"" designation on this review, but you basically end up with a silly monster movie - or something (??)

"This was the worst movie I've seen in 2022. The acting was absolutely horrible: melodramatic and mechanical at the same time and the characters way too quickly devolved into psychosis.

"I was very surprised that the ending of this movie was as predictable as I hoped it wouldn't be. As I was watching it, I kept thinking how it reminded me of ""Drag Me To Hell,"" but I figured there'd be a clever twist in the end. It certainly had an opportunity to do something different, and everything up to the end was executed very effectively. The film definitely earned the right to have a big moment, but the whole didn't add up to the sum of its parts, unfortunately.

We have no idea what his idea was for this movie so we can't say it's meant to be a ""message"" which is also a breathtaking thing because, for once, we have an ambiguous movie -- however it's a cut-and-dry horror movie that was obviously curated to be for the 80's and 90's cheese fans.This is a wonderfully little popcorn slasher that is what it is while trying not to be serious. It has your typical horrible character trope where you feel claustrophobic knowing that the main character is the only sane one.We have some cgi but also some prosethetics which I 100% enjoy.

"Smile has you at the edge of your seat for most of the movie anticipating a nice jump scare. Also a few gory scenes in it as well but the story just doesn't do it for me! They could have made a much shorter movie out of this and saved even more money on it and still made a ton in the box office. Not much really to say about the actors in it. Sosie Bacon does a good job in it and Kal Penn has a scene or two but nothing to rave about. And the ending really felt flat to me.

I also didn't like how the supporting cast was basically just left to the side; her fiance, her sister, her colleague, her therapist.

"This movie was a waste of time, and time you want back. Seems the only reason for this movie is a sequel. Very slow movie. If you want a actual horror movie, this is not it. You can see every jump scare and so on. The acting seems forced and no chemistry between actors, except the kid with his present, he needs an award. Most of this movie feels like you have seen it before, and it is because you have. Old gags and lack luster acting make it feel more like a cheesy airplane movie with no funny parts. The only horror with this movie is watching it, Do yourself a favor and don't. I seems the new directors have forgotten what the horror genuinely is and now its just represented by bad screaming...not even the good scream queens... and holding a big kitchen knife.",movie waste time time want back seems reason movie sequel slow movie want actual horror movie see every jump scare acting seems forced chemistry actor except kid present need award movie feel like seen old gag lack luster acting make feel like cheesy airplane movie funny part horror movie watching favor seems new director forgotten horror genuinely represented bad screaming even good scream queen holding big kitchen knife
"If you have ever seen any horror film before, this will seem like it really is - a naive, generic and badly written cash grab.Almost every aspect of this film has been ripped of from another, better film.The music is wanna-be scary and has nothing to do with what the film shows, the sound design is stupidly dishonest to squeeze a bit more reaction out of the audience, and the writing is... lackluster, to say the least. And the runtime is as exaggerated as some of the film's dialogue is terrible. Pretty much, that is.The smiling is so unscary and inconsistent throughout the film that it's actually hilarious. I would have loved to see Sam Raimi's version of SMILE, and it would have been a much better film.So if you're some horror newbie who finds smiling scary, have fun.

"I LOVE horror. I grew up watching everything from the old slower slasher films to psychological thrillers to jump scare central. This one gave me a nightmare that made me wake up screaming that night. No film has given me nightmares in 15 years. Most horror films only have 3-4 scary moments for me, even the scariest ones. However, with smile I either got goosebumps or jumped 20-30 times. I know some people found it silly but it really pushed a lot of personal buttons for me. I dont want to give spoilers, but I have two very specific horror tropes that actually scare me and this was jam packed with both!

"This very creepy film, which while being very effectively filmed, paced, lit and scored, has one other major asset.. it's cast, primarily Sosie Bacon.This proves once again when you populate your film with actors who can convincingly portray utter fear and terror (among a stunning array of other varying emotions) those feelings in turn transfer to the viewer and every effort pays off immensely.Generally in countless folkloric horror yarns, we are saddled with blas√© youths who ride the plot with the same level of intent and interest as if discussing rules & moves in some kind of interactive gaming chat. This movie managed to unsettle me even though there were idiots in the theatre behind me who would not stop talking. The only minor issue with this film (which may not really be important) is there is no real explanation as the the origin or purpose of the smile 'curse'.. unless I missed something (I was being distracted after all).Keen observers may recognise the first smiling victim as Aussie TV soap actor Caitlin Stasey who starred alongside Margot Robbie

I've seen pretty much everything here many times before.Not content with ripping off the concept of It Follows, the filmmakers actually rip-off the look of the most memorable iteration of the It Follows villain.

"""Smile"" is an interesting concept that sort of loses steam by the end of the film. It centers around Kevin Bacon's daughter essentially inheriting a curse where she hallucinates people smiling at her. Those demons insist that she kill herself so she can pass on the curse to the next person who witnesses a suicide. Overtime, she hunts for clues with very forgettable side characters and she is faced with the real reason behind why she has the curse.The strongest part of this film is definitely the performance from Sosie Bacon who really nails the horror elements with her non verbal acting. The weakest part would have to be the storyline and characters from the creators part. If you want to have a couple scares, this may do the trick. However, this is pretty by the numbers and sort of has no point by the end of the story.",smile interesting concept sort loses steam end film center around kevin bacon daughter essentially inheriting curse hallucinates people smiling demon insist kill pas curse next person witness suicide overtime hunt clue forgettable side character faced real reason behind curse strongest part film definitely performance sosie bacon really nail horror element non verbal acting weakest part would storyline character creator part want couple scare may trick however pretty number sort point end story
"Please excuse immature title, I couldn't resist. Made you look though.I was quite surprised by this film, I expected something far less effective. A lot of recent horror films have become very formulaic with jump scares and an insipid, instantly forgettable plot. Smile, though it does have those jump scares, boasts some quality performances and has an atmosphere that really sticks with you for a long time afterwards. It's not the first time this main conciet has been used, the sinister smile, but here it's used to genuinely disquieting effect.One thing, apropos nothing really, I did notice and, perhaps it's just me, but I was struck by how much Sosie Bacon looks like Jim Carrey. Watch it again and think ""Ace Ventura"" and in some scenes you'll be struck by the likeness. It kind of took me out of the film a bit, I kept imagining her saying ""alrighty then"" in tense moments.",please excuse immature title resist made look though quite surprised film expected something far le effective lot recent horror film become formulaic jump scare insipid instantly forgettable plot smile though jump scare boast quality performance atmosphere really stick long time afterwards first time main conciet used sinister smile used genuinely disquieting effect one thing apropos nothing really notice perhaps struck much sosie bacon look like jim carrey watch think ace ventura scene struck likeness kind took film bit kept imagining saying alrighty tense moment

This 2 hour movie will leave you glued to the screen and I'm sure you will enjoy it. There's no need for a 2nd movie as everything was wrapped up.

"I honestly did not expect much going into this film because as most people know, (especially horror fans) is that you usually have to deal with the usual by the numbers Hollywood type of movies throughout the year. This may be one of them for you, as fellow horror fans tend to be the most critical of horror, and they have the right to be, because they have seen it all and have had to endure a lot of stinkers. All I can say here is that for me, this movie creeped me the hell out.Everyone has that one type of horror or visual or tone that draws out their one deep rooted fear. Most fans dislike jump scares, which is the lowest form of unearned scare for most fans, and this movie did have it's fair share, but if a movie has already checked that box of yours, it will only intensify your dread. This is what it did to me, making me squirm around in my seat while making me feel I was also being stared at from somewhere within the room. I will admit there are a few points in the movie that could have been done better of should have been done a bit differently, but for the most part I think it's pretty effective. I remember clearly thinking at one point in the move, this is the way It Follows should have been done. On another note, I particularly despised the sister and brother in law characters. They were the worst.I don't know if this movie will have the same effect when seeing it a second time. Maybe not unless you give it some time to get out of your recent memory first. I noticed in the end credits that Studio ADI did the effects for this, so that no doubt is a big contribution factor in the final product.",honestly expect much going film people know especially horror fan usually deal usual number hollywood type movie throughout year may one fellow horror fan tend critical horror right seen endure lot stinker say movie creeped hell everyone one type horror visual tone draw one deep rooted fear fan dislike jump scare lowest form unearned scare fan movie fair share movie already checked box intensify dread making squirm around seat making feel also stared somewhere within room admit point movie could done better done bit differently part think pretty effective remember clearly thinking one point move way follows done another note particularly despised sister brother law character worst know movie effect seeing second time maybe unless give time get recent memory first noticed end credit studio adi effect doubt big contribution factor final product
"I want to start of this review by saying that I don't understand the people here giving thumbs down to reviewers giving the movie a 10, when a vast number of the reviews have solid arguments and objective points to why this film is great.Personally, this was a very enjoyable watch and an epitome of a trauma horror film. As a previous reviewer pointed out - the 2010s decade of horror will be looked back at as the decade using trauma as the main theme and this movie delivers big in showcasing messages in this context. The film also uses perfect pacing which made it nearly impossible to accurately anticipate jump scares. The coloring, camerawork, and script are also on point.All in all, this was a great film which I recommend not only to horror fans, but everyone that wants to watch an original and highly crafted film.

"My preference for horror movies is simple. I either want a film with an absolutely insane script with lots of violence or something with outstanding quality and care put into it. Smile falls in the middle. Smile is a well-made film that clearly had lots of heart put into it. Smile follows the same themes of grief and trauma as iconic horror films the Babadook and It Follows. Yet Smile has insane jumpscares on a level just below a film like Sinister. While the film has a few flaws, I still find myself drawn to it.One of the things that draws me to this film is the performance of Sosie Bacon. This film would not be nearly as successful if not for Sosie Bacon's performance. Bacon is the daughter of iconic film stars Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon. Clearly, she took a page out of her parent's acting books because her performance was captivating. She brought life and personality to a character that could have easily been just another character with a traumatic past. I enjoy the creepy atmosphere that first-time director Parker Finn brings to the film. If this is his directorial debut, I'm excited about his future in horror. The amount of jump scares throughout the film felt like a bit of a drag. I knew just about every time things went quiet- a jumpscare was on the way. Even with a bit too many jumpscares, I felt the look of the film's monsters and the ending were both able to reel me back in by the end.8/10 An excellently effective horror with fantastic acting and a solid theme, only slightly weighed down by a few too many jumpscares.",preference horror movie simple either want film absolutely insane script lot violence something outstanding quality care put smile fall middle smile well made film clearly lot heart put smile follows theme grief trauma iconic horror film babadook follows yet smile insane jumpscares level film like sinister film flaw still find drawn one thing draw film performance sosie bacon film would nearly successful sosie bacon performance bacon daughter iconic film star kyra sedgwick kevin bacon clearly took page parent acting book performance captivating brought life personality character could easily another character traumatic past enjoy creepy atmosphere first time director parker finn brings film directorial debut excited future horror amount jump scare throughout film felt like bit drag knew every time thing went quiet jumpscare way even bit many jumpscares felt look film monster ending able reel back end excellently effective horror fantastic acting solid theme slightly weighed many jumpscares

"Yet another crap horror movie that somehow made a lot of money. This is one of those movies I watched which I spent more time laughing at rather than being creeped out by. This movie is hilariously awful and idiotic.Firstly, let me start by saying the lead character Rose Cotter played by Sosie Bacon, is extremely annoying to watch. She is a whiny and pathetic wreck of a character than I wanted to just get killed off rather than overcome her challenges. Most of the actors in this movie are laughable in their performances.Next, one thing I absolutely despise in movies is characters that are experiencing not being able to tell reality from dreams or hallucinations. This movie is filled with that which makes it even more annoying to watch.Lastly, the premise of this hilariously awful movie feels like someone saw those stupid smile filters and thought to make a movie because of that. The deaths and gore in this movie comes across as absolutely laughable.The only positive from this movie is that it looks decent with the lighting and color palette.While it is laughable it isn't a great so bad its good movie so skip this crap.",yet another crap horror movie somehow made lot money one movie watched spent time laughing rather creeped movie hilariously awful idiotic firstly let start saying lead character rose cotter played sosie bacon extremely annoying watch whiny pathetic wreck character wanted get killed rather overcome challenge actor movie laughable performance next one thing absolutely despise movie character experiencing able tell reality dream hallucination movie filled make even annoying watch lastly premise hilariously awful movie feel like someone saw stupid smile filter thought make movie death gore movie come across absolutely laughable positive movie look decent lighting color palette laughable great bad good movie skip crap
"Normally, horror movies don't scare me, The only 2 horror movies that I really enjoyed were Sinister and It Follows. These two movies stayed with me longer than any other horror movie until I watched Smile. Something as simple as a smile can be terrifying, if eyes don't express the same emotion. The sinister smile from the movie imprints in your mind and haunts you on your car ride back home after watching the movie. I was remembering it while taking off my shoes, while looking in the mirror in the bathroom during my night time skin care routine, while laying in my bed before going to sleep. I was both scared and amused at the same time for the kind of games my mind was playing because of the movie. Bottom line is this movie delivers. One of the best horror films of the year.",normally horror movie scare horror movie really enjoyed sinister follows two movie stayed longer horror movie watched smile something simple smile terrifying eye express emotion sinister smile movie imprint mind haunt car ride back home watching movie remembering taking shoe looking mirror bathroom night time skin care routine laying bed going sleep scared amused time kind game mind playing movie bottom line movie delivers one best horror film year
"This is the only movie that've really scared me because this is the only movie where it can really happen in real life and there's nothing anyone can do about it. If a crazy off themselves, people would just think it's another case of the crazies offing themselves...or is it?The music... oh the music in this film is unparalleled, it's like the birth of the Sun, illuminating years of bland film music throughout the past quarter century or so. Forever brightening the past and the future. I don't know how to describe the music except that it makes the film that much more visceral and tense. I can tell you for a fact, the movies that get the film and the music right are legends, example: gladiator, braveheart, schindler's list...etc. And many films may be a good film, but fall short on the music aspect. I believe this is the only film that has its music/sound effects on the SAME level(if not better actually) than the film itself. If i was a film teacher, i would just ask everyone to study this film when it comes to effective music/sound editing in a thriller/horror genres.The directing. The director is the closest thing to Kubrick since he died. This is because, purposely or unintentionally, the direction combined with music takes us back to the past decades of the 1960's, 70's and 80's. A time when the horror was crisp and unrelenting. In my opinion the close up shots and eerie music makes this a clear homage to the 70's horrors. Another Kubricesque note is the ""focused"" style of the film, ""very in your face"" so to speak via close up shots. A unique aspect of the director himself is that he is able to make the film believable, as in there are snippets of unique directing that peaks the film to greatness(and these are also my favorite parts). Examples include: the introduction of the second patient in the room in the beginning, the house call by the psychaitrist. Another Kubrick moment is the hospital room in the beginning, very meticulously clean and organized just like how kubrick likes to do it.Weakness: i don't know if it was insisted by the producers, but the jumpscares didn't do anything for me as my favorite genre are thrillers. There are some scenes that's a bit bland and pedestrian. And the fact that the supporting cast was pretty bland. Now, i do have to say i think there are probably better ways to shoot a scene and add certain scenes. For example I would've added scenes such as: she getting into an elevator full of people and stand in the back, and then all of them turn around smile at her in an evil way. I may also add a sequence where she's in a mall or a carnival and everywhere she turns everyone has an evil smile and she can't find a normal person. I may also add a scene where she goes into a hospice where she kills an elderly and also kills the only witness.Tip: i knew this was going to be a great film because if fell into my ""sweet"" range on the imdb score: basically is a movie with over a thousand votes lands anywhere from 5.9 to 6.5 it's going to be 4/5 for me, 6.6 to 7.0 is going to be close to be 5/5, 7.1-7.5 is about a 3/5 and 7.6 and above is 2/5-3/5. Anything below 5.9 is usually 1/5.Cool thoughts: It would be cool if they can show this film in a mental ward, i wonder what their reaction would be. Would they think this film is similar to what they experience? Would the film make them feel better or worse? I would also like to know if anyone became crazy from this movie. I may add to this review as more thoughts pop up..",movie really scared movie really happen real life nothing anyone crazy people would think another case crazy offing music oh music film unparalleled like birth sun illuminating year bland film music throughout past quarter century forever brightening past future know describe music except make film much visceral tense tell fact movie get film music right legend example gladiator braveheart schindler list etc many film may good film fall short music aspect believe film music sound effect level better actually film film teacher would ask everyone study film come effective music sound editing thriller horror genre directing director closest thing kubrick since died purposely unintentionally direction combined music take u back past decade time horror crisp unrelenting opinion close shot eerie music make clear homage horror another kubricesque note focused style film face speak via close shot unique aspect director able make film believable snippet unique directing peak film greatness also favorite part example include introduction second patient room beginning house call psychaitrist another kubrick moment hospital room beginning meticulously clean organized like kubrick like weakness know insisted producer jumpscares anything favorite genre thriller scene bit bland pedestrian fact supporting cast pretty bland say think probably better way shoot scene add certain scene example would added scene getting elevator full people stand back turn around smile evil way may also add sequence mall carnival everywhere turn everyone evil smile find normal person may also add scene go hospice kill elderly also kill witness tip knew going great film fell sweet range imdb score basically movie thousand vote land anywhere going going close anything usually cool thought would cool show film mental ward wonder reaction would would think film similar experience would film make feel better worse would also like know anyone became crazy movie may add review thought pop
"The film is a ripoff of The Ring, carries on the boring formula of standard Horror Film - trying to find out why the pattern happens, loads of filler conversations, predictable storyline, and jump scares.It would be interesting to have at least some character development, yet it continues to be a carbon copy of your usual 00s horror film with stereotypical characters.It's interesting that it is topping the box office for weeks, if this is our taste for movies then it is worrying.

"We were both plenty scared though I expected to be the only ones in the theater since we went to the earliest showing at 1145am and unfortunately, there were maybe five or six other couples so I found a lot of opportunities to make the audience laugh during the movie with stupid anecdotes and jokes. However, the movie is plenty scary (I keep turning my head looking for the girl smiling from the beginning to be behind me) and the plot is decently written but there are some dumb plot holes in which the problem could be easoly solved. The ending was the worst part of the movie but it precludes that there will definitely be a sequel probably due to be released next Halloween if not the following. Some bad acting from some of the characters but all in all, it was a pleasant movie to watch and I do recommend it.",plenty scared though expected one theater since went earliest showing unfortunately maybe five six couple found lot opportunity make audience laugh movie stupid anecdote joke however movie plenty scary keep turning head looking girl smiling beginning behind plot decently written dumb plot hole problem could easoly solved ending worst part movie precludes definitely sequel probably due released next halloween following bad acting character pleasant movie watch recommend

"I appreciated the first kill in this movie and 3/40 jump scares. One of the best jump scares was put into the trailer leaving 2 jump scares worth the 40$ to see this movie. The idea of Smile was great but was very poorly executed. The movie had many plots that didn't go anywhere ie: the sister, the husband... The time line felt jumbled. It was unbearably slow when it should've been fast and fast when they should've slowed it down. It almost doesn't feel like a horror movie and shouldn't be labeled as one instead it should be labeled ""comedic thriller.""

"Really? Seriously? This picture is a thin collection of jump scares strung together with a wafer-thin plot. It got so bad that, as I watched it, I thought, wow, it's been about six minutes since our last jump scare. One is due right about - yup, there it is, right on schedule.However, as it wore on, and my patience wore thin, I developed a greater source of irritation. In movies about the supernatural only our protagonist recognizes their existence. The rest of the cast is certain that they don't exist. That's only true in the movies. We are living at the intersection of the 21st and 13th centuries. If I announced that I was being attacked by Venusian bat monsters I would likely have people saying, really? You too? I thought that they only bothered me! I'd be offered herbs, candles, chants and amulets to ward them off.Perhaps the worst of it was that we will likely have to endure 10,000 sequels and reboots.

"I feel like the previews showed most of the interesting scenes.The movie lacked contrast because they tried to make every moment spooky. They should not have gone overboard trying to make pointless scenes spooky. Pick and choose. It's like it had too much of the same ambiance.The movie could have been more interesting if it had something other than the same spooky ambiance. Like mysterious historical aspects about the entity ambiance, mysterious research and investigation ambiance, and team work and collaboration good feels.You design a movie like you design a painting or a song. Not one color, not one note. You need different layers and types. There were mysterious research notes, and collaboration and team work notes, but it was not in depth enough. I wish they expanded on that a lot. It was too quick and easy and not in depth enough.I found at the end maybe her mom didn't commit suicide. That her mom asked for help and to call an ambulance and she didn't.I don't like how she dies in the end. I feel like her research should have helped. She should have researched more and find something else out.This movie teaches us to be more empathetic to crazy people. Like, it feels real to them. It's very stressful.

"Decent premise but lacking in originality. Can't reinvent the wheel with every film but borrows a bit too much from recent, and honestly, better outings in the horror genre.Jump scares obvious from a mile off, interesting plot that devolves into routine predictability and unless you're a passionate horror buff the ending will leave you disappointed and frankly feeling like the film was a waste of time.Despite some nice touches from Parker Finn, the problem at the core of this film is that it simply isn't very scary.

"Or so I thought until the pre climax hit and there are filler scenes which only extend the climax or the director thought they need a few more jump scares and added those scenes.But, keeping those scenes apart, It really starts off well and creates this eerie and cold atmosphere within 10 minutes into the movie. The screenplay is well written that it keeps you glued and Sosie's acting as Rose stayed true to the core.There are a few camera angles and a couple of drone shots which are quite unique but doesn't serve much purpose except for the drone shots which have a hidden relevancy to the plot.The jumpscares are neatly placed and well executed except for the last act and the background music is just on point.",thought pre climax hit filler scene extend climax director thought need jump scare added scene keeping scene apart really start well creates eerie cold atmosphere within minute movie screenplay well written keep glued sosie acting rose stayed true core camera angle couple drone shot quite unique serve much purpose except drone shot hidden relevancy plot jumpscares neatly placed well executed except last act background music point

"Everything is so very predictable it's a joke- nothing is original. The initial idea was good- but that's not enough to make a good film. The sound design was not good nor the foley, the music wasn't convincing, the acting was poor and the character development was even worse. And the upside down drone footage was out of place even though it was intended to serve as a special effect to make the audience uncomfortable. It was wasted and clumsily forced into the movie, together with all the other ""surprises"" that were so predictable it wouldn't even pass though as a 80's b-roll.If you have watched any 5 horror films from the 80's or 90's- you've seen everything there is to see in this film already.

"Docked this movie a few stars simply because the plot has been done before...Fallen (1998) starring Denzel Washington had nearly the same premise. An evil spirit that can jump from one body to the next.

"This should've remained a short film since the original plot was expanded with horror cliches and the lead screaming and freaking out the majority of the film.

Acting was so over the top that it was almost funny. And the ending was SO predictable. They made you wait 2 hours for that!? This is far from Horror. The most scary thing about this film was how much money it reeled in at the box office. Now that's SCARY. Who actually likes this junk!? Now I know why Amazon and Netflix make movies, cause it's too easy to make these modern films. There is absolutely no thought or effort put into these films.

"I would give 10 stars for the astonishing unsettling atmosphere. For once the picture, the editing, the music and the sounds are well placed.I would give 1 star for two main issues: having a main character that is a sort of psychiatrist that melts down a bit too quick. And the too many unresolved ""in your face"" scare parts where the entity is grabbing the character's face then... fade to black and jumping into the next scene ?!?! Although I give that in some other scenes that is properly treated showing the ""aftermath"" of being something simply imagined.The MAIN ISSUE anyway is the very poor ending. Comparing this to ""the ring"", which is inevitable, we notice two things:
1. In ""the ring"" the evil is never fully disclosed: it does not speak, it does not show its face at full, it does not play hide and seek...
2. It is a one single build up scene with a one final delivery. It is not a compilation of looks-like-the-end, yet again.Compared to ""it follows"", which is also inevitable, the benefit of ""it follows"" is that it does not put a face to the evil. So it is untouchable. Despite ""it follows"" is ruined by precisely having that moment where the entity shows its fierce evil by... punching people...So, nice start, poor developing, terrible ending. Nice shots, nice atmosphere, but poor delivery due writing. They copied ""the ring"" and ""it follows"" yet they did not profit of the good things from them, and even repeated the wrong paths ""it follows"" took.",would give star astonishing unsettling atmosphere picture editing music sound well placed would give star two main issue main character sort psychiatrist melt bit quick many unresolved face scare part entity grabbing character face fade black jumping next scene although give scene properly treated showing aftermath something simply imagined main issue anyway poor ending comparing ring inevitable notice two thing ring evil never fully disclosed speak show face full play hide seek one single build scene one final delivery compilation look like end yet compared follows also inevitable benefit follows put face evil untouchable despite follows ruined precisely moment entity show fierce evil punching people nice start poor developing terrible ending nice shot nice atmosphere poor delivery due writing copied ring follows yet profit good thing even repeated wrong path follows took

You can only do so much with horror today where it's not over the top eye-rolling. This one has me jumping a few times and I usually make fun of these movies. Combining elements from a ton of different flicks, it doesn't come off as some hokey, ""don't you see it, everyone's crazy but me!"" nonsense that so many of these movies use.

"This movie didn't make any sense to me for a few reasons:1: If the entity in the movie is trauma and it spreads from host to host through witnesses of deaths involving the host, then what happens if the host commits a murder or suicide in front of a group of people? Do all witnesses get targeted or does the entity pick just one? Will this be the sequel? Smiles?2: From what I understand, the entity can't actually cause physical harm until it enters the host, so who killed the cat? Was that all a hallucination? If the cat was really dead in the box, then it makes no sense why Rose would kill her cat considering she was not yet consumed by the entity. Also, if trauma is the entity, then wouldn't the little kid be traumatized by that? To me, this doesn't really make sense or seem consistent with the symbolism (unless I missed something).3: Again, If the entity is trauma and that is the symbolism behind the movie, why is it that when you murder someone to express said trauma does it then cure you or transfer the trauma to the witness and leave you alone? That's not really how trauma works. The only logic I can think of is that trauma can turn people into sociopaths/psychopaths who then harm others but this wasn't the case with the character Rose encounters in jail. He was remorseful and fearful of the entity and therefore didn't become a version of it himself. To me, this creates a major inconsistency in the logic behind the symbolism and they did a bad job portraying whatever it is they were trying to say.",movie make sense reason entity movie trauma spread host host witness death involving host happens host commits murder suicide front group people witness get targeted entity pick one sequel smile understand entity actually cause physical harm enters host killed cat hallucination cat really dead box make sense rose would kill cat considering yet consumed entity also trauma entity little kid traumatized really make sense seem consistent symbolism unless missed something entity trauma symbolism behind movie murder someone express said trauma cure transfer trauma witness leave alone really trauma work logic think trauma turn people sociopath psychopath harm others case character rose encounter jail remorseful fearful entity therefore become version creates major inconsistency logic behind symbolism bad job portraying whatever trying say
"I loved the experience of watching this movie - tension builds authentically and with patience and gravity. I held great hopes. The film straddles two genres: drama and horror.The problem is that ideas about an ""evil presence"" or a ""supernatural entity"" are always a glaring weakness when trying to tell horror/drama stories - you can always see the seam if it's not disguised well.'The Exorcist' handled this brilliantly, by introducing medical examination of what the characters are going through. We take comfort in the fact that science can easily dispel fears. When science fails to address a problem, thing begin to get scary, as long as the timing, writing and effective direction is done well. This movie does much that works but goes too quickly to get to the supernatural before establishing the scientific credentials.We get to the protagonist freaking out too early, and we are stuck with horror tropes for too long. Even if the affliction can be partly explained by science, we are still made anxious because it makes no sense overall - people are getting hurt. It just needs more focus on toying with what the audience already knows is real and break that down slowly. The visual effects and loud noises don't scare as much as our view of the known world fragmenting for the audience. They are not fools. Wanna scare them - take their real world more seriously. Focus less on fx and boo-scares. This movie should be a slow burn.",loved experience watching movie tension build authentically patience gravity held great hope film straddle two genre drama horror problem idea evil presence supernatural entity always glaring weakness trying tell horror drama story always see seam disguised well exorcist handled brilliantly introducing medical examination character going take comfort fact science easily dispel fear science fails address problem thing begin get scary long timing writing effective direction done well movie much work go quickly get supernatural establishing scientific credential get protagonist freaking early stuck horror trope long even affliction partly explained science still made anxious make sense overall people getting hurt need focus toying audience already know real break slowly visual effect loud noise scare much view known world fragmenting audience fool wanna scare take real world seriously focus le fx boo scare movie slow burn
"This was a great psychological movie and people just need to stop comparing it to other movies. You just have to appreciate and enjoy psychological movies to enjoy this one. I would however like a second one just because the way this one ended. I wasn't too scared much but also wouldn't look at every bad thing that happened because I didn't want the image stuck in my head. Some things I thought were funny in the movie like the way the sister acted like an almost ""basic white girl"" and how the sisters argued. I had just expected a happy ending and didn't get that and I know that's most likely what the director wanted you to think so that you didn't expect the ending but it does make me want another one with a good ending.",great psychological movie people need stop comparing movie appreciate enjoy psychological movie enjoy one would however like second one way one ended scared much also look every bad thing happened want image stuck head thing thought funny movie like way sister acted like almost basic white girl sister argued expected happy ending get know likely director wanted think expect ending make want another one good ending
"I Love halloween time, some good horror movies come out, and I was looking forward to see Smile. A lot of hype around it due to the marketing as well.From the beginning, you directly get quite disturbed, due to the music and camera angles, mostly. When the story starts to unfold, I really felt like... I have seen this: it follows, final destination, The Ring,... people running for their faith of death, as they got chosen to be the next victim. So, not directly an original concept. The further it got, the more disturbing or frightening. The jump scares were all well timed and build ups well executed... but everything missed something. For sure the end. Without giving any spoilers, I saw the ending coming. It wasn't original. And the creature in the end, reminded me of the grandmother in IT - part 2. Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself... but, I had too much of deja-vu all throughout the movie, which I believe makes it a bit forgettable and overrated. I hope they come with a better story line for part 2.",love halloween time good horror movie come looking forward see smile lot hype around due marketing well beginning directly get quite disturbed due music camera angle mostly story start unfold really felt like seen follows final destination ring people running faith death got chosen next victim directly original concept got disturbing frightening jump scare well timed build ups well executed everything missed something sure end without giving spoiler saw ending coming original creature end reminded grandmother part nevertheless enjoyed much deja vu throughout movie believe make bit forgettable overrated hope come better story line part
"What people have been saying is right, in a sense: this is an above-average mainstream horror movie. The problem is that the average mainstream horror movie is atrociously bad, so yeah, this is better, but it's not great.To be fair, I don't think this is a ""bad"" movie; it's just not much better than okay. I can say it's shot pretty well. The music is good at points. Other things, though, can vary. The performances ranged drastically in quality, with some great and some terrible. The lead actress does a serviceable job for the most part, although there are some points where she's not quite convincing. The story itself isn't all that original: if you've seen a transferable curse movie before (The Ring, The Grudge, It Follows), you know exactly how this will play out.The real shame is that there are flashes of greatness buried in all the mediocrity.*MILD SPOILER* The monster design was (as far as I can tell) done practically and looked great. There are scenes that have some really interesting ideas. Unfortunately, there are also scenes like the birthday party, which, for me, was unintentionally hilarious.All in all, yes, this is a watchable movie, but not nearly as good as the hype I've seen around it.",people saying right sense average mainstream horror movie problem average mainstream horror movie atrociously bad yeah better great fair think bad movie much better okay say shot pretty well music good point thing though vary performance ranged drastically quality great terrible lead actress serviceable job part although point quite convincing story original seen transferable curse movie ring grudge follows know exactly play real shame flash greatness buried mediocrity mild spoiler monster design far tell done practically looked great scene really interesting idea unfortunately also scene like birthday party unintentionally hilarious yes watchable movie nearly good hype seen around
"I went in thinking that this was going to be a terrible horror movie, however I was wrong. This movie is suspenseful and the story line followed all the way through. There are still some plot holes that could be filled in but overall the movie was excellent. The question still remains as to whether someone is really experiencing demons or mental illness. There were some really creative jump scares ðŸ˜± and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The only reason I picked an 8 was because there were a few spots that just didn't make sense.

"It's undeniable that ""Smile"" is one of the best horror films of 2022.Not only it has all its technical aspects in check (cinematography, acting, editing, and so forth), it's mindful when it comes to its plot, and it shows insight and structure toward its chosen core: Psychological Trauma.It's a perfectly enjoyable film as is, definitively above average (and not only for its genre), so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.But I can't help to mourn a bit the masterpiece it could have been, if only Parker Finn had decided to dig a little bit deeper with its metaphor, and to get inspiration from the essence of ""It Follows"" instead of grabbing its most superficial aspects.Those two films show glaring similarities on the surface, but also crucial differences, the strongest one being the ""entity"": In ""It Follows"" it becomes an extremely rare example of a truly and utterly unavoidable evil, whilst in ""Smile"" it gets to win only because its plot armour allows it to.For this very reason I find ""Smile""'s ending lacking, and in light of the heavy metaphoric elements in the film, downright questionable.It's pretty straightforward that the ""entity"" is an embodiment of trauma, and for a good chunk of the film it acts accordingly: it haunts its preys, it drags them in isolation and alienation, it can become generational, and it spreads on whoever lays eyes on it.But going forward the metaphor gets muddy, and instead of adding meaning to it, the film follows the very formulaic horror trope of ""save yourself from evil by spreading it"".I think we can all agree that whilst is unfortunately common to hear about victims of trauma inflicting trauma to others, nobody has ever saved themselves from their inner pain by spreading more of it around.""Smile"" is smart enough to introduce the topic with sensitivity, but it fails to find an equally insightful resolution to the issue. Which, in my opinion, would have been ""The Babadook"" ending.The ""entity"" should have been be unbeatable (and it wasn't: there's one very easy and particularly horrible way to get rid of it without hurting others, but I was very relieved the film didn't go there. Not the message you want to spread, ffs), because there is no beating trauma.But there's coping with it, and growing stronger despite of it. And as a therapist, our Dr. Rose should had known that better than most.",undeniable smile one best horror film technical aspect check cinematography acting editing forth mindful come plot show insight structure toward chosen core psychological trauma perfectly enjoyable film definitively average genre hesitate recommend help mourn bit masterpiece could parker finn decided dig little bit deeper metaphor get inspiration essence follows instead grabbing superficial aspect two film show glaring similarity surface also crucial difference strongest one entity follows becomes extremely rare example truly utterly unavoidable evil whilst smile get win plot armour allows reason find smile ending lacking light heavy metaphoric element film downright questionable pretty straightforward entity embodiment trauma good chunk film act accordingly haunt prey drag isolation alienation become generational spread whoever lay eye going forward metaphor get muddy instead adding meaning film follows formulaic horror trope save evil spreading think agree whilst unfortunately common hear victim trauma inflicting trauma others nobody ever saved inner pain spreading around smile smart enough introduce topic sensitivity fails find equally insightful resolution issue opinion would babadook ending entity unbeatable one easy particularly horrible way get rid without hurting others relieved film go message want spread ffs beating trauma coping growing stronger despite therapist dr rose known better
"The movie was very scary ,the acting was very great and I really loved the concept of the whole movie. The reason I voted this movie 8 stars and not 9 or 10 is because the screenwriting wasn't very original to me and I also didn't really enjoyed the ending as much as the other parts of the movie. I felt like the cast did a really good job trying to make it for us the movie as much scary as possible but as I said a little bit earlier the screenwriting wasn't as good as the movie quality or the acting and sometimes felt like the screenwriting was a copy from another movie and I would also prefer a different ending becuse the ending felt like a way to end the movie way faster then it should,but except for those details.

"I rarely watch horror movies because they're so predictable. This followed right along into the predictable lane. The actress/character was so overly dramatic. The script was cringey.

"Acting - great, atmosphere - great, storytelling - not so much.First off the birthday present scene was one of the best scenes I've seen in 2022. The mental breakdown and descent into chaos and panic was awesome.I was expecting a more thorough explanation behind the curse or the phenomenon or the symptom or whatever it was that caused people to smile and kill themselves. Was her mother cursed? And by who/what? I was disappointed that we didn't get the origin story of the curse (which almost every decent horror movie does), did she had some mental illness, schizophrenia maybe? The curse clearly attacks traumatized people. Why was her mother traumatized and killed herself by taking pills?The curse monster is pretty creepy too.",acting great atmosphere great storytelling much first birthday present scene one best scene seen mental breakdown descent chaos panic awesome expecting thorough explanation behind curse phenomenon symptom whatever caused people smile kill mother cursed disappointed get origin story curse almost every decent horror movie mental illness schizophrenia maybe curse clearly attack traumatized people mother traumatized killed taking pill curse monster pretty creepy
"Somehow I got sucked into watching this movie. Acting and directing were fine. The movie was intriguing at the beginning, as most of these movies are. But eventually when the ""rubber hit the road"" (and i.e. The plot became exposed), at about 60% into the movie, it was a great disappointment. This felt like a slightly poor copy of many other horror films. The movie has an overlay of psychological intrigue (past emotional trauma), but the two themes (true horror movie and psychological drama) never really meshed. And of course numerous other movies attempt the horror-psychoanalysis connection also, and do it better. (In this movie, it just seems that the protagonist is haunted, and by coincidence she has emotional trauma. The two really do not seem linked, unless one wants to assume that the protagonist is hallucinating the whole movie; in which case the plot is even worse here.) Still struggling to see why the same themes keep popping up.... But again -- acting and directing are good; and movie is captivating; just a major letdown at the end.",somehow got sucked watching movie acting directing fine movie intriguing beginning movie eventually rubber hit road e plot became exposed movie great disappointment felt like slightly poor copy many horror film movie overlay psychological intrigue past emotional trauma two theme true horror movie psychological drama never really meshed course numerous movie attempt horror psychoanalysis connection also better movie seems protagonist haunted coincidence emotional trauma two really seem linked unless one want assume protagonist hallucinating whole movie case plot even worse still struggling see theme keep popping acting directing good movie captivating major letdown end

"Smile ....
The movie has a nice strong story (although it reminded me with a Denzel Washington movie ""Fallen""), BUT...... there are many missed parts in this movie that can make it a successful one. I will try to make my idea clear:
1. The movie started with the main scene and in which the psychologist was shocked, but we didn't see any part about her previous life, my question while watching the movie was: had this woman looked normal before?2. Her relationship with her sister was so tough, it was difficult to see them in a one family picture.... and even when she needed someone it was obvious that her sister wasn't the one.3. The most important point is that: there are no strong dialogues in the movie; I didn't enjoy any actual conversation. I understand that this doctor has issues but still she was running all the movie without those scenes or dialogues linking the events in the film.I continued watching to the end just because I wanted to know the end not because it was an enjoying movie to watch.And guess what! The myth behind this smile entity wasn't told, although her ex-boyfriend tracked the chain of the previous suicides but nothing told us where it came from.",smile movie nice strong story although reminded denzel washington movie fallen many missed part movie make successful one try make idea clear movie started main scene psychologist shocked see part previous life question watching movie woman looked normal relationship sister tough difficult see one family picture even needed someone obvious sister one important point strong dialogue movie enjoy actual conversation understand doctor issue still running movie without scene dialogue linking event film continued watching end wanted know end enjoying movie watch guess myth behind smile entity told although ex boyfriend tracked chain previous suicide nothing told u came
"It's a re-skin, if not somewhat a retelling, of the Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, and James Gandolfin movie Fallen. Replace the angel phenomenon with a psychotic spirit that requires or thrives on trauma of others to kill and move between its victims one after another. It continues along the Fallen trail throughout the film down to the idea of getting it alone in a remote place where it can't continue to another victim, but with a slight twist as the story continues (and it's not the cat). It's production and editing are also so very familiar with story telling of the period and before. It's an enjoyable film, worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre.",skin somewhat retelling denzel washington john goodman donald sutherland james gandolfin movie fallen replace angel phenomenon psychotic spirit requires thrives trauma others kill move victim one another continues along fallen trail throughout film idea getting alone remote place continue another victim slight twist story continues cat production editing also familiar story telling period enjoyable film worth watch fan genre
"This film used suspense very well and is very very, scary.The film is very well acted and wastes little time. It becomes creepy, very quickly with several disturbing scenes early on in the film. Where Smile succeeds over a the other horror films of today isn't just the cast though--its the directors ability to build tension and suspense. I haven't seen a film that built suspense this well since Hereditary.This is a great film for this Halloween season and is best seen in theaters.

It definitely had creepy moments. I don't scare easily, but this one got me a couple of times. The scene where Rose is at her sister's house, and her sister is outside of Rose's car, in particular. The actress who played Rose, did a phenomenal job in my opinion. Honestly, all of the actors and actresses played their characters well. Smile almost had an It Follows feel to it, only way better.

"There's a lot to like about SMILE. I think Rose's PTSD spiral and the various aspects of PTSD behavior was well handled. The aspect of trying to appeal to people who will reject you and rejecting help from people trying to help is very true. Sosie Bacon's performance is great. And I appreciate the story kept things straightforward and didn't bog it down with too much back story and over explanation. However, while I enjoyed the film it came up short. I felt the film lacked sophistication (and I don't mean in an elevated horror way). It all felt a little too mechanical and clunky. The camerawork (slow pans and upside-down shots) and music felt forced. Too many jump scares. The story telegraphed too many things. And the entity was a typical scary monster that robbed the film of its fear factor at the end. If you compare Gore Verbinski's RING remake to SMILE, because they follow a very similar story arc, both directors used similar style techniques but Verbinski created something very fresh and scary, whereas Parker Finn failed to get any cohesion from these techniques and his influences so it all felt a bit too forced.",lot like smile think rose ptsd spiral various aspect ptsd behavior well handled aspect trying appeal people reject rejecting help people trying help true sosie bacon performance great appreciate story kept thing straightforward bog much back story explanation however enjoyed film came short felt film lacked sophistication mean elevated horror way felt little mechanical clunky camerawork slow pan upside shot music felt forced many jump scare story telegraphed many thing entity typical scary monster robbed film fear factor end compare gore verbinski ring remake smile follow similar story arc director used similar style technique verbinski created something fresh scary whereas parker finn failed get cohesion technique influence felt bit forced
"First off, Sosie Bacon has earned herself a place in horror protagonist history with that stellar performance, much like Toni Collette in Hereditary. I will definitely be on the lookout for future films with her in it.Compared to the trailer, this well exceeded my expectation. It was predictable at times and director Parker Finn didn't do anything new that we haven't seen before. Nonetheless all the tension and uneasiness that I felt throughout the film was effective. 10/10 on the creepiness scale.As others have mentioned before, the story is very reminiscent of The Ring and It Follows but still unique enough to warrant its own viewing. The cinematography was top notch as with the score.Overall, Smile was a pretty fun horror experience to watch with friends who don't normally frequent the genre. I could've done with a bit less jump scares and trust that the tension of the story can build on itself until its ultimate conclusion. The best scene was the birthday party and I wish they explored more with the nephew.P. S. For those who haven't seen Smile yet, please avoid the trailers. The best jump scare was featured in one of the trailers.",first sosie bacon earned place horror protagonist history stellar performance much like toni collette hereditary definitely lookout future film compared trailer well exceeded expectation predictable time director parker finn anything new seen nonetheless tension uneasiness felt throughout film effective creepiness scale others mentioned story reminiscent ring follows still unique enough warrant viewing cinematography top notch score overall smile pretty fun horror experience watch friend normally frequent genre could done bit le jump scare trust tension story build ultimate conclusion best scene birthday party wish explored nephew p seen smile yet please avoid trailer best jump scare featured one trailer
"I was really looking forward to watching this and I was really disappointed. . . . the first time.It came on Sky movies (other and better such services are available) so I thought I'd watch it again because parts of it were okay.I see it now for what it is a metaphor for mental illness and a spooky gitbag of a demon/spirit/creature feature.Spoilers probablyAfter witnessing a patient kill herself horribly our protagonist, played very well by Sosie Bacon, starts seeing things. She puts it down to the stress of witnessing such an awful thing (you would be traumatised) and tries to carry on.Over days she falls out with her fiancé (who is a selfish a*hole imo) she has a hideous episode at a party for her nephew (I won't spoil that) and is told to take time off from a job she loves.She turns to her ex (helpful to the plot) who is a police officer (even more helpful for the back story) for help.The creature chooses her because she was a witness to its previous victim AND because she is holding on to guilt and trauma about her Mum.We eventually see (big spoiler) that she did not go for help when her Mum had overdosed. This is because she was 10, she could have called 911 but didn't, she had spent all her life scared of her mentally ill Mum but not knowing why her Mum was like that. She was 10, she wasn't able to help her Mum. She wasn't capable of giving her Mum what she needed because she was a kid. Her Mum needed medication or a therapist, I don't know. I have depression, I felt I wouldn't have been a good Mum so I chose not to have kids. This is not judgement for depressed mothers, they are doing everything they can, this is just me.Through having this creature in her, and stress and lack of sleep, the protagonist tells people how she really feels, her fiancé, her ex and her sister.She acts badly, in socially unexceptional ways, she swears, she acts out. Depression does this to people.She tries (and fails) to face her demon and kill it without a witness.She then realises that she has to kill herself and the demon (as they are one now) without any witnesses to break the chain. She can see no other choice, it will be best for others, it is the only way to beat the demon in her head.This film is actually a really good metaphor for depression and I didn't see that the first time.I have given in an 8 because the jump scares are overdone, some of the characters are one dimensional and the music annoys me after awhile.",really looking forward watching really disappointed first time came sky movie better service available thought watch part okay see metaphor mental illness spooky gitbag demon spirit creature feature spoiler probablyafter witnessing patient kill horribly protagonist played well sosie bacon start seeing thing put stress witnessing awful thing would traumatised try carry day fall fianc selfish hole imo hideous episode party nephew spoil told take time job love turn ex helpful plot police officer even helpful back story help creature chooses witness previous victim holding guilt trauma mum eventually see big spoiler go help mum overdosed could called spent life scared mentally ill mum knowing mum like able help mum capable giving mum needed kid mum needed medication therapist know depression felt good mum chose kid judgement depressed mother everything creature stress lack sleep protagonist tell people really feel fianc ex sister act badly socially unexceptional way swears act depression people try fails face demon kill without witness realises kill demon one without witness break chain see choice best others way beat demon head film actually really good metaphor depression see first time given jump scare overdone character one dimensional music annoys awhile
"The film overall was a thrilling enough experience. The first act raised the bar quite enough for the rest of the movie, the second act's pacing was a bit slow for my liking but overall it definitely had its memorable and creative moments, and the third act is where it all went downhill. Too many loose ends with her relationships, and the ending was very rushed and not at all satisfying. The lazy ending left a lot to be desired, left me feeling that my investment in the story was pointless, and the director may have just run out of budget to make it worthwhile.

From the advertising and trailers you would think the movie would be better. You could almost predict everything that was going to happen from jump scares to straight out story line. Some of the jump scares were not needed and didn't help move the movie along. It felt like they were just adding scary things without thinking about incorporating jump scares that would make sense to the antagonist. The main antagonist made little to no sense in the fact that it's a being that can only exist if someone watches a suicide. It does bring up the question of how it all started and the movie does nothing to explain it. Overall the movie was just plain boring. It follows a therapist who has a patient who dies and she lives with trauma. It's very unoriginal and not an attention grabber.,advertising trailer would think movie would better could almost predict everything going happen jump scare straight story line jump scare needed help move movie along felt like adding scary thing without thinking incorporating jump scare would make sense antagonist main antagonist made little sense fact exist someone watch suicide bring question started movie nothing explain overall movie plain boring follows therapist patient dy life trauma unoriginal attention grabber

There's very few films that really manage to get into my head but this was one of them, straight from the outset I was filled with dread.I'm aware that fear is subjective and what scares one person, may not scare the next but this film for me personally encapsulated psychological terror. Everything about it was anxiety inducing, particularly the sound design, even the title screen got under my skin and the use of upside down camera shots was a simple but clever touch as it just adds to the unnatural personality of the film. The actors have mastered that disturbing smile to the point where it felt like they were staring into my soul, it was perfectly spread out into unpleasant sections of dread, to the point where I felt relief when scary scenes came to an end, not that the unsettling atmosphere ever stops but it was a slight relief nonetheless.I've watched horror films all my life but this was truly visceral and had me pleading inside with it to be over because for the first time ever, I wasn't sure if I could finish it. I'm glad I did because for once, it's a horror film that doesn't fall apart at the end but I was also relieved that it was over. I'd recommend Smile to anyone who is after a psychological scare because it is absolute nightmare fuel from start to finish and the best horror film I've seen in a long, long time.",genuinely terrified film really manage get head one straight outset filled dread aware fear subjective scare one person may scare next film personally encapsulated psychological terror everything anxiety inducing particularly sound design even title screen got skin use upside camera shot simple clever touch add unnatural personality film actor mastered disturbing smile point felt like staring soul perfectly spread unpleasant section dread point felt relief scary scene came end unsettling atmosphere ever stop slight relief nonetheless watched horror film life truly visceral pleading inside first time ever sure could finish glad horror film fall apart end also relieved recommend smile anyone psychological scare absolute nightmare fuel start finish best horror film seen long long time
"Saw it last night...Smile part degenerates into a paranoia melodrama and its ending is disappointingly clichéd.The other big fail for me was the Trevor character's wavering acting, especially when the main couple are both standing in front of the car at night, having it out in an intense dramatic scene.But the film is still highly fresh and competent - especially its super creepy sound design, Sosie Bacon's agitated acting, the slow zoom shooting plus shock editing - like It Follows, but with less dissociation, more menace, and many more gut punch jump scares...I even sat through the whole credits at the end to listen to that wonderfully eerie score on the sound system of my local cinema.Overall, this one's a win for me, but not quite a masterpiece.",saw last night smile part degenerate paranoia melodrama ending disappointingly clich big fail trevor character wavering acting especially main couple standing front car night intense dramatic scene film still highly fresh competent especially super creepy sound design sosie bacon agitated acting slow zoom shooting plus shock editing like follows le dissociation menace many gut punch jump scare even sat whole credit end listen wonderfully eerie score sound system local cinema overall one win quite masterpiece
"First off I am NOT a professional critic. I just really really enjoyed this film and thought I would give my 2¢ and praise.I found it very reminiscent of It Follows. Wow. I was kind of blown away on how good this was. Definitely this years top horror in my opinion. So so many good spooks and the perfect amount of silence. It kept me in edge the whole time and there was never a period in which I thought ,""now is a good bathroom break"". This movie should at least have an 8 on IMDb (which is a 10 in the horror community). Ms. Bacon crushed this role and the supporting cast was incredible. The composition and score are so so good.

"A troubled psychotherapist is witness to her patient's apparent suicide and is thereafter wrapped up in something something something, plot.To cut a long review short it's a slightly re-jigged, simpler and far less intelligent version of the far superior movie Fallen from 1998.The actors do a decent job of carrying the non-sensical script and illogical actions of their characters, and they are the only redeeming features. Once un-masked the monster is standard googly-arms-and-legs silly and loses all of it's ability to frighten. The ending is obvious almost from the point you understand what's happening.So in summary and with few redeeming features this places it firmly in meh territory.

"This was a good, old fashioned horror flick that was chock full of scary moments and a little bit of gore, but not too much.Sosie Bacon sure has grown up since I saw her the first time on her mom's show ""The Closer"" and she has turned into a good actor. She does a great job of looking tired/worried/scared/psycho and the movie can leave you on the edge of your seat or in the case of one teenage girl in the theater- almost soiling herself. The young lady farted so loud during one scary scene that the whole theater erupted in laughter- and I needed it because the movie had my heart pounding.I think the only thing that hurts this movie is they use the shock moments too often that they became predictable, you started to expect something was about to startle you whenever it got quiet on the screen.I had hoped the ending wouldn't be what I expected about halfway through the movie, but alas, it was.I didn't think much of the actor who played Sosie's fiance, he was a little stiff, but the rest of the cast did a pretty good job.",good old fashioned horror flick chock full scary moment little bit gore much sosie bacon sure grown since saw first time mom show closer turned good actor great job looking tired worried scared psycho movie leave edge seat case one teenage girl theater almost soiling young lady farted loud one scary scene whole theater erupted laughter needed movie heart pounding think thing hurt movie use shock moment often became predictable started expect something startle whenever got quiet screen hoped ending expected halfway movie ala think much actor played sosie fiance little stiff rest cast pretty good job
"I really enjoyed this movie at first, it was ominous, jumpscares worked effectively, and fun storyline, then I watched it again. The idea of the movie is good on paper, but the weird shots made no sense and the camera thinks its artistic when it's really a ahit that makes your head hurt. The movie builds cheap tension that a first time filmmaker might do and I find it really stupid how the evil being works. The movie never gives us any rules for the being besides it kills within 4-7 days and someone has to see the ""suicide"" the cheap character building scenes suck because we never root for these characters, it's more your weird cousin that no one likes is telling the story and you listen cause you feel bad.

"Sosie Bacon treats the script of Smile as if it were her key to racking up tons of awards. Her spirit is admirable and she's able to spin gold from straw many times and elevate the predictable material, especially as the latter half dissolves into a series of confusing fake out daydreams and nightmares where you're never quite sure what's going on or what's at stake for the character. It's loaded with jump scares - some are effective and some are duds - but at least the filmmakers have supplied a good amount of mood and dread to go along with it. As good as some of the scares are, it does get exhausting after awhile.",sosie bacon treat script smile key racking ton award spirit admirable able spin gold straw many time elevate predictable material especially latter half dissolve series confusing fake daydream nightmare never quite sure going stake character loaded jump scare effective dud least filmmaker supplied good amount mood dread go along good scare get exhausting awhile
"I can't believe Paramount allowed so much to be stolen from The ring....the face scene of the teacher, the thing that kills you after 7 days...seriously?The scene with the tall mom coming out of the room was good but when you see her face the movie immediately changes from horror to comedy. Come on people, there are 100 different ways to make her scarier only by changing her eyes to look more demonic.

"Well, I liked it. Has some inconsistencies but nothing debilitating. Odd as I watched a movie with similar plot issues recently (Barbarian) that I didn't particularly like. I guess sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. Overall this is pretty good. And as a bonus you get a new reason to TRY AND STOP someone from killing themselves, aside from the whole decent thing to do business that's going out of fashion in modern decision making. I realize if someone's waving a gun around and acting crazy you'd likely choose to keep your distance, but a pottery shard? I suspect, actually I know, that people treating emergency psychiatric patients touch upon that sort of thing in training. But hey, there's been ""other chains"" so maybe the malevolent beastie has to occasionally take a time out... but gets to restart again. I don't know, I'll ponder it awhile. The urge to do so is a good indicator the movie is decent. Some plot holes I could care less about resolving. Pretty good if you don't need the rules all clear cut (it possessed traumatized people to ultimately kill them but prior to that takes a couple test drives to whack a cat and whatnot). See what you think. Better than Barbarian for what that's worth.P. S. The ""did you break another glass line"" is a great example of humor and horror subtlety working together.",well liked inconsistency nothing debilitating odd watched movie similar plot issue recently barbarian particularly like guess sometimes journey important destination overall pretty good bonus get new reason try stop someone killing aside whole decent thing business going fashion modern decision making realize someone waving gun around acting crazy likely choose keep distance pottery shard suspect actually know people treating emergency psychiatric patient touch upon sort thing training hey chain maybe malevolent beastie occasionally take time get restart know ponder awhile urge good indicator movie decent plot hole could care le resolving pretty good need rule clear cut possessed traumatized people ultimately kill prior take couple test drive whack cat whatnot see think better barbarian worth p break another glass line great example humor horror subtlety working together
"This movie succeeds in what it sets out to do. Namely be a spooky movie. Whether that's your cup of tea or not is another matter entirely.So many movies particularly of late fail in what they're attempting to accomplish. So I do applaud the producers of this movie for actually getting the job done that they wanted to get done.There's nothing new here really. It definitely has a bit of the vibe from it follows. And for the first 10 minutes or so they seem determined to replicate a lot of the camera effects from Unbreakable.Over top of that toss in a good helping of story elements from The Ring.Do the characters actions always make sense? Well is that exactly a fair question to ask in a movie where you're expected to believe in a supernatural Force making smiley people do bad things?Alfred Hitchcock had his characters get into peril because he wanted them to get into peril. It didn't matter what was in the character's best interest. And we have a bit of that here. More than a bit.But you're being asked to believe in a ghost story or something like it. So you pretty much have to go with it.And I found that I could. I found the main character reacted not so dissimilarly for from how I might react when faced with a supernatural threat. She's freaked out a fair bit and yet she does what she's able to, to understand and overcome.I have to say that in the end I walked away entertained. It's not a 10 out of 10 it's not going to win an oscar but I didn't go here to see Gone with the Wind. I went to see a scary story. Accomplishment unlocked: view a scary story.View it in that way and I think you'll find it worth your time. Is it worth a rewatch? No, again this isn't Gone with the Wind.

"It isn't easy to make a good horror film, but this film certainly put forth a good effort. My main gripe with this film was the dialogue. I think the poor dialogue really detracted from the story. The dialogue writing felt very amateur, almost like it was pulled from a student film or written by someone who doesn't know how real people talk. Rose's sister and brother in law were so over the top pompous, it completely took me out. With that being said, this film does two things very well. For starters, this film has excellent jump scares. The jump scares happen frequently, and they got me every time. They definitely made for an enjoyable watching experience. The second thing this film does well was the ending. I felt like most of the plot was pretty predictable. I saw the cat in the box coming from a mile away, which unfortunately killed all the build up of the birthday party scene. However, the ending was a great misdirection. I really thought it was going to end on a nice note of her driving away! I think the ending we got was great, and a positive ending would have worked well for the film too. The idea of her conquering the demons of her past was equally as appealing to me as the idea of her being brought down by them. Side note, this is the worst Kia ad I have ever seen.

Dr could have easily researched the same information that the prisoner did, but that wouldn't have allowed the dramatic seen.

"It brings an eerie atmosphere when it makes you think the characters cannot get out of terrifying events that they had witnessed. However, I have to say there're lots of jumpscares. Also, the film is, I'd say, 75%-80% similar to It Follows (2014) from the concept to the ""evil entity"".The ending could be an open-ending and to me it'd be ""happy"" and proper if it ends there. If there would be a part 2, the story should be expanded and be more creative to be able to attract viewers. Or else it'd be an ordinary horror franchise.In addition, I have to say that the music in this film is brilliant.",brings eerie atmosphere make think character cannot get terrifying event witnessed however say lot jumpscares also film say similar follows concept evil entity ending could open ending happy proper end would part story expanded creative able attract viewer else ordinary horror franchise addition say music film brilliant

Was really looking forward to this film. My son said it was scary. Fits few minutes lived up to the promise. Seemed very good. It all goes very well and all makes sense. A few jump scares which were ok and got you going a little. It felt slightly original. Some genuinely interesting scenes that really hot my interest but about 15-20 minutes before the end of the film it all goes drastically wrong. I'm guessing they just run out of ideas. It made no real sense. It was trying but I lost all interest at this point. It had real promise ip until this point. Genuinely gutted.

"Smile feels like the director just wanted to make a horror movie but didn't have an original idea. So he copied the story of It Follows. I also found similarities of shooting style with Midsommar, like turning the road upside-down while driving to give an intense tone. The lines that characters spoke made me cringe throughout the whole move. It was so unnatural. I can't decide whether the acting or the script is worse.

"After seeing the trailer, I was excited to see this. It had a great premise even though It Follows did the pass along curse better. There were some decent scares in the beginning and some great cinematography and plot twists that made me wonder what would happen next. But midway through, everything became predictable. I predicted how it would end and I was right, sort of. But the one thing that really annoyed me was the typical movie trope where the protagonist learns invaluable information but doesn't share it with anyone to prove something is really going on. But no, she keeps it to herself so that the professors wife, her sister, her fianc√©, and her psychiatrist all think she's crazy. Instead she yells ""You don't understand!"" or ""You're not hearing me!"" after giving the most convoluted and confusing description of everything except the most important facts. Would they have understood? Who knows. Her police detective ex-boyfriend only knew after a day of doing her bidding. Even then, she didn't tell him what the prisoner told her and he just let it go. So for him being the lone person knowing all this information, of course he was the one the curse passed along to in the end. And speaking of the end, after all the gruesome bloody deaths... lighting yourself on fire? To a seasoned police detective who's probably seen it all? I don't think so. Just like this movie in general.",seeing trailer excited see great premise even though follows pas along curse better decent scare beginning great cinematography plot twist made wonder would happen next midway everything became predictable predicted would end right sort one thing really annoyed typical movie trope protagonist learns invaluable information share anyone prove something really going keep professor wife sister fianc psychiatrist think crazy instead yell understand hearing giving convoluted confusing description everything except important fact would understood know police detective ex boyfriend knew day bidding even tell prisoner told let go lone person knowing information course one curse passed along end speaking end gruesome bloody death lighting fire seasoned police detective probably seen think like movie general

"One of the best psychological horror/thriller movies that has come out recently. Smile is packed with jump scares, some more obvious than others, but it doesn't rely heavily on those tropes to keep you scared. The acting, editing, atmosphere, and of course those damn smiles, are gripping enough to keep you uncomfortable throughout the entire story. Yes, it's worth pointing out that this movie has a similar feel to It Follows, but it's not some Greta Van Fleet-type knock off. Shout out to Sosie and the rest of the cast and shout out to the ever-present theme of mental health that once again slips its way into a modern-day storyline.

"I love horror films, always have. I think it started when I first watched ""Jeepers Creepers"" when I was 15. Great film. However I have never watched a film in cinemas to the point where my heart was racing at a hasty pace. So the first day it was released I had to go and see it with my sister. ""Smile in short words is about a clinical psychologist who witnesses a bizarre disturbing death of a patient and soon begins to experience the same frightening occurrences as her patient"".""Smile"" has it all! It's psychological, gore, lots and lots of JUMP SCARES, creepy, frightening. Horror buffs will love it. I cannot say it has a completely different plot to an alternative horror, because it doesn't. It has the similarities of ""Ring"". Some may even say ""It Follows or ""Truth or Dare. Although some scenes may be repetitive, it had definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. In some cases even looking away from the screen.The ending was what I think terrified me the most. The psychologists mother transforming into a 10ft freakish demon was a real shocker. Even talking about it is giving me goosebumps. I guess most horror films are the most terrifying at its finale.It takes an awfully terrifying movie for me to LOOK AWAY. This was one of the three. It might have put me off horror films slightly. Some scenes may be repetitive, the plot may be the same to previous horror films and the ending may be predictable to some. However it's an OUTSTANDING film. It's TERRIFYING, CREEPY, DISTURBING, with a whole lot of JUMP SCARES! Most definitely a must watch!",love horror film always think started first watched jeepers creeper great film however never watched film cinema point heart racing hasty pace first day released go see sister smile short word clinical psychologist witness bizarre disturbing death patient soon begin experience frightening occurrence patient smile psychological gore lot lot jump scare creepy frightening horror buff love cannot say completely different plot alternative horror similarity ring may even say follows truth dare although scene may repetitive definitely kept edge seat case even looking away screen ending think terrified psychologist mother transforming ft freakish demon real shocker even talking giving goosebump guess horror film terrifying finale take awfully terrifying movie look away one three might put horror film slightly scene may repetitive plot may previous horror film ending may predictable however outstanding film terrifying creepy disturbing whole lot jump scare definitely must watch
"Generally agree with some other reviewers: ""well made but generic."" Great acting, especially Bacon. Maybe a decent artistic ""statement"" on the viral nature of trauma. But in the end, just imagine The Ring except the VHS tape passed around is instead watching someone commit suicide with a creepy smile on their face. And for the love of god if suicide triggers you DO NOT WATCH THIS. No clever irony intended.I would also avoid if jump-scares bother you. Not a fan of them myself. In my humble opinion they are the definition of cheap thrill. Oh, something was out of frame, now....it's not. I mean c'mon. Can't get any cheaper.",generally agree reviewer well made generic great acting especially bacon maybe decent artistic statement viral nature trauma end imagine ring except vhs tape passed around instead watching someone commit suicide creepy smile face love god suicide trigger watch clever irony intended would also avoid jump scare bother fan humble opinion definition cheap thrill oh something frame mean c mon get cheaper
"Decent horror movies are few and far between and this was one of the best new ones I've seen in recent years. It won't be an everlasting classic, but it was enjoyable, well-made, had a good story and cast, and it kept my attention with no eye rolling. That says a whole lot nowadays. It did not, however, scare me, but it's been decades since a movie has. You can't win 'em all, I guess. Anyway, I'm not going to give a big old plot synopsis, there are trailers, etc for that, but the movie rolls along at a nice pace after this therapist ends up with some kind of evil entity trailing her after witnessing the suicide of a patient which the entity had previously been stalking. Of course nobody believes her, so she has to figure out some way to ditch this entity without having to commit suicide herself. It's good and you feel sorry for the lady because you can pretty much imagine everyone around you in real life behaving the same way if the same thing happened to you. Lol. Definitely worth watching. And if you are somehow torn between watching this or ""Barbarian,"" definitely pick this.",decent horror movie far one best new one seen recent year everlasting classic enjoyable well made good story cast kept attention eye rolling say whole lot nowadays however scare decade since movie win em guess anyway going give big old plot synopsis trailer etc movie roll along nice pace therapist end kind evil entity trailing witnessing suicide patient entity previously stalking course nobody belief figure way ditch entity without commit suicide good feel sorry lady pretty much imagine everyone around real life behaving way thing happened lol definitely worth watching somehow torn watching barbarian definitely pick
"This horror was both enjoyable and entertaining. The acting was good and kept me engaged. My main problem with horror film is when you feel that you've seen it all before. Smile had some nice moments it as it got to the final stages,?things started to really deteriorate.I'm not saying that it was cliche-ridden claptrap but it was getting there. To be honest, I could guess the ending. Such a shame when you want to be pleasantly surprised by something different or something clever.Then there's the special effects. They were poor. Better effects in a game. I lose my engagement with the film when it's that bad.Such a shame.

"Based on the number of times people laughed in the cinema hall, I think it's a fairly good comedy movie. In all seriousness though, no just skip. I only watched it because I was too late for Bullet Train and I had to kill a few hours at the mall. That's the review. Now I'm in my mid 30s, and I have no one in my life. It seems that is not going to change. I just don't get it, I mean everyone finds someone. Why can't I? Am I that ugly, that evil? And it's not like I have unrealistic expectations.

"The idea of this movie and the trailer really appealed to me. The movie however was a huge letdown. The only ""scary"" scene in the movie was the patient's death. I understand that not all movies try to go for an in your face type of horror but this movie was not scary even in the slightest. When I think about it I wish i'd seen this movie without seeing the trailer first, the only significant scenes in this movie were featured in the trailer. The ending was let's say... predictable.

"I enjoyed it, because well I love movies, especially horror. However it did lack jump scares for those who love this genre. The quality also decreases when you know the ending within 10 minutes at the latest. Make the common movie ending change.. Don't leave a sequel open, you don't need a sequel to everything. An ending came to mind, when she makes it back to Joel's apt, she sees the yellow couch she mentions earlier in the movie after her speech, and then it cuts away to her sister and firemen finding her body in the house fire.

"The movie title, cover, and trailer are all awful and do the movie no favors. I had absolutely no interest in watching this. It looks basic, very familiar, and uninteresting. Almost everyone i know who has seen it, only ended up watching it because someone else recommended it to them and said it was 'surprisingly good'. This is the same reason i ended up watching it. And I'm glad i did.The title should be the same as it's short ""Laura Hasn't Slept"". ""Smile"" is a painfully boring name. The cover should be the creature climbing inside someones mouth. Again, bad marketing team.The films main idea isnt original, but the story it builds around that idea is very interesting and effective. The scenes, cinematography, creatures, acting, and scares are all really well done. Way more than you'd expect. And minimal cheap jump scares is always something respectable from a horror movie. The scares this movie offers aren't loud shock scares, but deep, menacing chills.

"I am writing this from the theatre from sheer boredom.All that has happened after an hour so far is nothing you haven't already seen in the trailer. Just jumpscare after jumpscare to fill up the run time due to the nonexistent story. It has gotten to a point where things have gotten so monotonous and cliché that I started to be able to tell which scene the jumpscares were about to happen. Other than the ""creative sound editing"", the non-existent story unfolds at a snail's pace without ever being worthwhile.By the time it gets to the second hour, its frantic need to prove itself a worthy watch has started to show. However it's all shock value.I gave it an extra star for the gripping performance by the female lead. But overall, the movie falls short in producing an engaging storyline and any originality.This could almost be a ripoff of a certain Asian film called ""The Grudge"".In short, this is an endless cacophony of jump scares masked as ""directorial mastery"".If you're planning to see this in the cinema, I'd give this a pass.

"Whether it's generic or not I couldn't really say; but what does it matter? The bottom line is that in a genre where there is so much dross, this is a sharp and gripping film that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.What this film does so well is keep you guessing as to where the next scare is coming from - to the point you're already unnerved before it arrives. The device of juxtaposing something positive (a smile) with a horrific event (death) may not be revolutionary, but it's used to such great effect here you have to wonder why more films don't do it.Smile also avoids falling into the traps that mar others in the genre - the settings and interactions are all convincing and draw you in and it's not filmed in the dark either.I would definitely watch this again.",whether generic really say matter bottom line genre much dross sharp gripping film keep edge seat way film well keep guessing next scare coming point already unnerved arrives device juxtaposing something positive smile horrific event death may revolutionary used great effect wonder film smile also avoids falling trap mar others genre setting interaction convincing draw filmed dark either would definitely watch

While the story itself isn't too special and has quite a few horror clichés it certainly good enough to keep you in the movie. Where it really shines though is the atmosphere and the scares. You're constantly on the edge of your seat. Normally in a horror movie I feel safe during the day time and am usually afraid during the night time but that's not at all how I felt watching this movie. The scares themselves are great aswell and definitely not used to often. It's a great movie if you want good scares because it really does get you. Also the reason for the high rating.

"Great supernatural death chain movie! Really gave off the Ring vibes but just a little more contemporary. Love the device of using the smile as a way to make you feel uncomfortable - something that is normally happy is absolutely terrifying here.Making the audience completely on edge the whole time with her constantly hallucinating was great, you never know whether the monster is present or not. My favorite was when she was talking to the therapist and it's the middle of the day and it's calm...then the phone rings and it's the therapist. Gold. I love when a medium makes you uncomfortable during the day - that's true horror.Unfortunately, the CG is rather off in the finale as most recent horror movies but it doesn't take away from the overall experience.

"I have nothing negative to say in terms of acting, image, build-up... But hey, is there any believable script over there?

What is the reason of this manifestation? Why is it plaguing only certain people?If the only explanation we have is that the main character is supposed to be punished for the fact of being afraid and tired, as a young child, of an abusive parent whom she had chosen to abandon to their fate when they had asked her to call the emergency line...

"The movie Smile is actually quite interesting. It's different from most movies I've seen but also similar to some, so it's got a small amount of creativity as well as its own uniqueness. Rose was not a very good choice of main character. I get that she had trauma herself, but when it came to actually helping people (being a therapist) it just doesn't make sense. She runs away from her problems, and when her patients need actual help, she calls in other nurses to tackle them to the ground. (An example would be Carl). She also makes a lot of unnecessary problems about herself, like during her fight with her sister. It just doesn't make sense for Rose to be a therapist in this film, given her trauma and other problems outside of the workplace. I also don't understand why Rose continued to talk to her dead mother, even though she knew that woman was going to possess her because SHE IS DEAD.",movie smile actually quite interesting different movie seen also similar got small amount creativity well uniqueness rose good choice main character get trauma came actually helping people therapist make sense run away problem patient need actual help call nurse tackle ground example would carl also make lot unnecessary problem like fight sister make sense rose therapist film given trauma problem outside workplace also understand rose continued talk dead mother even though knew woman going posse dead

One particular character is introduced who stands out for a particular reason (trying to avoid any spoilers) but, when all is said and done, nothing is impacted in any way as a result of that character.

Lots of the decisions made by the characters were stupid and felt very forced by the writers to get the movie to the most unoriginal ending. Although there was a scene near the ending the was impressive.From a technical standpoint, the acting was on point especially with our lead who carried the whole movie. And the sound design was original. The horror elements were well built.Overall I see that the movie had a great potentiel but it felt like it was written in the early 2000s and made in 2022.",movie started strong first min hour movie get predictable lot jump scare already seen trailer lot decision made character stupid felt forced writer get movie unoriginal ending although scene near ending impressive technical standpoint acting point especially lead carried whole movie sound design original horror element well built overall see movie great potentiel felt like written early made

"This is a really scary movie. Not in a typical horror movie way, but it is messing with my mind. It is a psychological triller with horror elements in them. And jumpscares who actually make me jump. A lot of horror movies wants me to, but you see them coming. At the end it begins to feel more and more like a typical horror movie and it gets over the top. For me it is unnesessary, it was way more scarier if they kept it like the first part of the movie. The first part was so unsettling that it made me cry. Also the movie shows in a over the top way how you can overcome trauma if you battle tour inner demons.",really scary movie typical horror movie way messing mind psychological triller horror element jumpscares actually make jump lot horror movie want see coming end begin feel like typical horror movie get top unnesessary way scarier kept like first part movie first part unsettling made cry also movie show top way overcome trauma battle tour inner demon
It's certainly a film of two half's. The first half Got off to a really good start but slowly rolled downhill. Smile Feels like you have seen it before. I couldn't tell the difference between her reality or imagination which I found very confusing. The music is really creepy and It delivers a few loud scenes that do make you jump but it's predictable which takes the edge off. The second half is awful and almost comical in parts. Like so many horror films these days with so much potential from a simple idea but just not living up to the hype and certainly not it's name. Save yourself some time and watch the trailer as those are the best bits or don't and you may actually enjoy this film. Would not recommend.,certainly film two half first half got really good start slowly rolled downhill smile feel like seen tell difference reality imagination found confusing music really creepy delivers loud scene make jump predictable take edge second half awful almost comical part like many horror film day much potential simple idea living hype certainly name save time watch trailer best bit may actually enjoy film would recommend

I love a film that is t filled with cheap jump scares but I love a horror film with some sort of a genuine payoff. SMILE does not pay off. There are so many opportunities for this to have really been terrifying - I mean the lead character is a doctor in an emergency psych ward.....
Some sort of malevolent evil is stalking unsuspecting people and instead of turning it into a very claustrophobic and deeply psychological nightmare, the filmmakers give us a cheap backstory ripped right out of FINAL DESTINATION and then dilute it by broadening its scope without providing anything substantial.You can see the ending coming as soon as you see the first death. And frankly at 1 hour 57 minutes, it was about 1 hour and ten minutes too long.Don't bother.",see follows babadook several similarly themed film saw film well really love slow boil horror film love film filled cheap jump scare love horror film sort genuine payoff smile pay many opportunity really terrifying mean lead character doctor emergency psych ward sort malevolent evil stalking unsuspecting people instead turning claustrophobic deeply psychological nightmare filmmaker give u cheap backstory ripped right final destination dilute broadening scope without providing anything substantial see ending coming soon see first death frankly hour minute hour ten minute long bother
"Watched Smile over the long weekend. I got the impression it was a horror comedy from the trailers. It is not, the movie takes itself seriously. However, I did end up laughing anyway at some of the absurdness. It is very formulaic and predictable making hard to suspend my disbelief. The acting is decent but I found it very hard to connect with any of the characters, there is barely enough character development to even find them interesting. Had it been a horror comedy and not taken itself so seriously, I might've really enjoyed it. There is a bit of animal violence but it is incredibly fake.

"Sosie Bacon certainly has the acting chops of her parents in this disturbingly effective horror, as a mental health worker who struggles with her own sanity as she wrestles with a supernatural entity that seems into on destroying her life.Shocking jump scares and horrific images abound, but for once these are in service to the plot instead of distractions from the main event. In the end, the film leaves a lot more questions than answers, but I suppose this leaves the door wide open for any potential sequel (nix that 'potential' part, it's already in development).My only real complaints are a) The tiresome cliche that cats ALWAYS have to die in horror movies. Seriously, as soon as I see a cute moggy pottering about I know there's like a 90% chance it'll be wormfood by the end and b) Speaking of the conclusion, it does drag on for a bit with yet ANOTHER fake-out which by this point is becoming slightly an overused trope.That final shot is a doozie, though.

"Before anything else, this movie blatantly rips off signature elements from the movies It Follows, Turth or Dare, Mama, Rec, and The Ring; all of which were quite original and good movies - well at least I enjoyed them.Second of all, this movie has nothing to do with the short film it was absed on. The original short film was way better.My first problem is the freaking jump-scares. Anyone who thinks what makes a movie scary is jump-scares is... well, not a wise person, let's say. There are too many, too unnecessary, too misplaced jump-scares in the movie. And they aren't even scary. They are just annoying.The two-dimensional characters and the uncertainty regarding the ""villain"" (is it a curse? Is it an entity? Or is it all in my head?!) were... ""unexciting"", to say the least.I hope this was just a rookie mistake.",anything else movie blatantly rip signature element movie follows turth dare mama rec ring quite original good movie well least enjoyed second movie nothing short film absed original short film way better first problem freaking jump scare anyone think make movie scary jump scare well wise person let say many unnecessary misplaced jump scare movie even scary annoying two dimensional character uncertainty regarding villain curse entity head unexciting say least hope rookie mistake
"Firstly I loved the camera work and uneasy soundtrack, very simple but effective! Acting was really good especially from the main actress that I never heard of, she did great! Very believable! I'm more into mental horror movies than gore so this is more my caliber and I did enjoy it a lot until the last 15 minutes or so. For some reason I always hate when you see the 'actual creature' in horror movies. I prefer imagining it or just not seeing it, it makes it unbelievable to me and loses it vibe. I wish they'd have done something different like her killing someone to break the circle rather than what actually happened. That's why I gave it 7 instead of 10! But still great watch!",firstly loved camera work uneasy soundtrack simple effective acting really good especially main actress never heard great believable mental horror movie gore caliber enjoy lot last minute reason always hate see actual creature horror movie prefer imagining seeing make unbelievable loses vibe wish done something different like killing someone break circle rather actually happened gave instead still great watch
"The directing was quite spooky and deliberate.Good timing and pacing.The acting was pretty good throughout. Especially Sosie Bacon. She carried this film with a believable and likable performance, in a difficult role.The plot was uneven, and the neurosis seemingly a bit unrelated to the to the plot.The ending could have been better. The choice was not the best, and disappointing. The audience doesn't want to see Rose die. They want her to overcome her predicament and go off with her ex.This movie could had had a higher rating with a better ending. But it kept me interested, and guessing.

"I watched this on a whim as it kept showing up in my suggestions. Looked a bit ridiculous to me at first (smiling is scary?) but I actually found myself enjoying it. Is it a masterpiece of cinema or anything? No, but it's a solid movie that doesn't rely on buckets and buckets of blood just for the sake of it. There are a fair amount of jump scares but I didn't feel it was as overdone as many are. If you aren't looking too crazy deep and picking apart any holes you find it's not a bad movie at all. I found the therapist to be fairly likable, if a bit inept at her job in the beginning. Doesn't much matter though since she starts to spiral pretty quickly after she encounters the patient in the beginning, so really who cares about her therapy abilities lol.",watched whim kept showing suggestion looked bit ridiculous first smiling scary actually found enjoying masterpiece cinema anything solid movie rely bucket bucket blood sake fair amount jump scare feel overdone many looking crazy deep picking apart hole find bad movie found therapist fairly likable bit inept job beginning much matter though since start spiral pretty quickly encounter patient beginning really care therapy ability lol
"Let me start of by saying that I've been a horror fan my entire life, growing up on the slasher movies of the 70s - 90s which are still my favorite on the occasion they come out anymore (hooray Terrifier!). Even though this movie isn't that, I've grown a general dislike for the jump scare genre of horror which has by far been the most popular the past 20 years because they're always so predictable in how they create their scares.However, that said, this is largely a jump scare movie, but they do it right in my opinion. The jump scares are actually disturbing and unlike so many other movies in the genre, they're unexpected in different ways. I mean you can still tell what's about to happen like all jump scares, but the way they happen just have a bit of a twist on them than what we've come to expect. I watched it a couple days ago, and still have some of the images in my brain, so they did something right.The drawbacks of the movie are the acting which isn't particularly great from basically anyone, and the story telling is disjointed especially with the love story that turns out to be the most important of the entire thing. Overall though, pretty decent flick that I'd recommended to anyone who's into supernatural jump scare horror. How the ending connected to

"The main issue with this kind of movie is the need to show something original. The Smile tried. The premise seemed to lead that way. But, then, from the middle, it falls into the common place where almost all other films of the genre do. Due to this, the end was totally predictable and disappointing - to be honest, it would require a really new and unconventional idea to escape this.Of course, all mentioned above wouldn't make the movie necessarily bad, only forgettable. But it won't happen either. Knowing that it made a huge profit, we will probably see a sequence in the nearby future.And that is the main objective nowadays: establish a good franchise.

"'Smile' does not attempt to reinvent the wheel when it comes to horror, and doesn't have any lofty goals of being profound or thought provoking. It's only goal is to scare you, and it does a fine job of doing so. Elevated by a believable and captivating performance from Sosie Bacon, Smile is a fun and terrifying rollercoaster that never feels boring or derivative. While it certainly has some weaker elements, such as some spotty CGI and a very underbaked supporting cast (seriously what was the point of the boyfriend?), Smile is probably one of the scariest horror movies I've seen in quite a few years.Smile does not shy away from jump scares, and while they are plentiful they very rarely feel cheap or forced. The scares are earned, and there are quite a few scenes that are just deliciously terrifying and shocking. Smile is probably not going to win any Oscars, but it's a fun theater experience and a must see if you're a horror movie fan. At the end of the day, it succeeds at what it set out to do and takes what could have been a silly premise and turns it into a relatively captivating and terrifying story.",smile attempt reinvent wheel come horror lofty goal profound thought provoking goal scare fine job elevated believable captivating performance sosie bacon smile fun terrifying rollercoaster never feel boring derivative certainly weaker element spotty cgi underbaked supporting cast seriously point boyfriend smile probably one scariest horror movie seen quite year smile shy away jump scare plentiful rarely feel cheap forced scare earned quite scene deliciously terrifying shocking smile probably going win oscar fun theater experience must see horror movie fan end day succeeds set take could silly premise turn relatively captivating terrifying story

"This horror movie uses a lot of the same tropes as others, but thankfully does so in a compelling way. Definitely resulted in some jump scares and creepy moments. I feel like a lot of the pros this movie has to offer lies in its passing atmosphere and events. But the plot as a whole isn't very great, and it's about as shallow as ""evil smile"", despite making an attempt to grow out of that.The ending leaves a bad taste in your mouth: we're brought through this entire mental journey just to have her meet the same fate. Nothing is really learned or proved. I guess if I would've wanted one thing to happen, it would be an ending that wasn't expected. And not unexpected as in they fake a happy ending and then give us the expected bad ending, like an actual deviation that nobody saw coming.Also her boyfriend in the movie came off too flamboyant, I wasn't convinced.",horror movie us lot trope others thankfully compelling way definitely resulted jump scare creepy moment feel like lot pro movie offer lie passing atmosphere event plot whole great shallow evil smile despite making attempt grow ending leaf bad taste mouth brought entire mental journey meet fate nothing really learned proved guess would wanted one thing happen would ending expected unexpected fake happy ending give u expected bad ending like actual deviation nobody saw coming also boyfriend movie came flamboyant convinced

The sub-plot of generational trauma proves to be entirely irrelevant so I'm not even sure why it was part of the movie.All I can come up with was that some sort of entity causes people to kill themselves and if you witness this you'll also end up killing yourself and passing on the curse or whatever it is.That's it.

I do not want to see animals get hurt or killed in a movie, just stop doing this please.

"For a horror film this was actually very good. Lots of jump scares. Good use of sound effects. I noticed that Rose had a mug with a smiley face on it. There were some in jokes I think. Caitlin Stacey who played Laura who committed suicide infront of Rose was very convincing with her acting. I've followed her since her soap opera days (Neighbours, she is australian) She has come a long way. I thought Sosie Bacon gave a great performance also. Her journey through her own mental torture was interesting. The thing is, my friend and I figured the obvious answer was why didn't kill herself when she was alone?

"The Smile feels like it was made by a first semester film student, who took their book of techniques and a thought from tumblr and ran with it. Acting, camera, set etc are great but that doesn't help if the movie doesn't do what it's supposed to do. In this case (a horror movie) it was supposed to entertain me, instead it bored me. The jumpscares are lazy and predictable, the plot is chaotic at best, the dialogue is rocky and unnatural, the characters behaviours and reactions aren't believable. Even the juxtaposition of the traumatic ending scene followed by an upbeat song like Lollipop feels like they were following a formula. It's truly disappointing since the idea of passed on trauma holds so much potential.",smile feel like made first semester film student took book technique thought tumblr ran acting camera set etc great help movie supposed case horror movie supposed entertain instead bored jumpscares lazy predictable plot chaotic best dialogue rocky unnatural character behaviour reaction believable even juxtaposition traumatic ending scene followed upbeat song like lollipop feel like following formula truly disappointing since idea passed trauma hold much potential

The fact that she is even afraid of this thing is laughable. It's smiles at you kinda creepy and the movie is just not that scary. The ending is completely predictable.

Hats off to the director. Some say this is overrated movie. I don't say that it's overrated. As a person who believes in ghosts and all that stuffs, I find this movie a masterpiece. Super suspenseful movie. On the negative side, I will cut one star for making the movie too dark. A lot of viewers will find it disturbing to watch the violent scenes. But that's the thrill, right? It's very cold movie. I will cut one more star for the climax that makes no sense. I mean, at least there should be a conclusion or give us idea about the origin of the creature. So, I cut one more star for not revealing anything and just going with the flow without a background story to share. They missed on this part. I cut one more star for blood scenes. But the way it was executed was superb. However it gave me the vibes of wrong turn franchise. So, i kinda felt like I have already watched that. I cut one last star for making it too much horror. Yes, too much, a lot. So, it's a 5/10 rating from my side. Should you watch this movie? Absolutely yes. There's no boring part in it. But be prepared for the horror. All the time horror.

"I don't normally go to see horror films, or rate them very highly as I find that I don't get scared easily and watching them is a waste of my time. That's not to say I haven't watched any horror films. During lockdown I binged on some ""classic"" horror movie series, such as Halloween and the Elm Street series of movies just to tick them of my list of movies to watch. I've also watched more modern horror films (such as Paranormal Activity and The Conjuring) and rarely found them to be actually scary, except in maybe a few rare occasions in one or two places in the whole movie. Again, although I found these mildly entertaining, I didn't really get frightened and due to my heart medication (beta blockers) I don't normally jump at jump scares as my pulse rarely goes above seventy bpm. This film, however, I found utterly terrifying throughout. Easily the scariest horror film I've seen. It draws you in and sets a mood that has the hairs on your neck standing up and twitching throughout.

"The film is walking at the same path of ""it follows"". It has a very creepy atmosphere,with a very haunting score. The acting of the main character stands up. Some jumpscares perfectly placed and reinforced by the soundtrack. The end it's predictable but put together very well so it doesn'take away nothing from the film. Personally I didn't like some manifestations of that ""thing"" near at the end of it,so it would be more psychological directed as the the 2/3 of the film,But you can argue that that's just the mind.

"I've never been so tempted to leave a theater out of sheer boredom. Many of the actors have portfolios to show they are better than what we saw on screen. However, the actors weren't good enough to overcome what was clearly terrible writing and or directing.

This was one of those movies in which the studio released the trailer for it a month or two before it - that being said it helped with the containment of the story and the spoilers not being leaked.Acting is a 7/10 - some of the actors I felt did not exceed the expectations I had for them. Sacha Bacon killed it as usual.Gore/Horror is a 8/10 - hitting the mark with all the trops of what make a great horror movie.JSYK - THIS DOES NOT NEED A SEQUEL OR A SERIES OF FILMS.

"I'll try to make the short sharp and simple the movie has a good premise of basically an entity pursuing someone through trauma it however had a lacklustre plot shown by the order of events I felt it could have been better. I feel however the cast were good and worked with what they had stand outs were the original patient, friend cop and the psychiatrist I however felt that the entity could have been a lot scarier given the way that the suicides were carried and the art in and around this film. It has an almost dizzying over use of upside down camera and drone shots such as the beginning of Candyman which has left me nauseous and just as disorientated as when the film started out I give this film a 5 out of 10 only saving itself from Smile ruin with the clear parodies of other horror films such as alien and it follows and the cast's performance with the lines available to them.",try make short sharp simple movie good premise basically entity pursuing someone trauma however lacklustre plot shown order event felt could better feel however cast good worked stand out original patient friend cop psychiatrist however felt entity could lot scarier given way suicide carried art around film almost dizzying use upside camera drone shot beginning candyman left nauseous disorientated film started give film saving smile ruin clear parody horror film alien follows cast performance line available
"I felt really uneasy and almost left early. The story is better than in most horrors, the acting is one of the best I saw in the genre. But the jump scares and their anticipation was a bit too much. If they were a bit toned down, I'd appreciate the movie more and it would seem a bit more psychological. In its current state it is not really rewatchable for me.I'll check out other films by the director though.Seen on a medium sized cinema screen on a Tuesday 20:45 with approx. Ten 40 year olds in the audience. The women were squirming and men giggling loudly (me included).

"It's about time people embrace new kind of horror. It's not the movie that should be judged by jumpy moments as some reviews say the movie is lacking of.

So, grow up.Some reviews say the story is confusing, well, paying attention to the movie is a start.

"The most believable parts of the movie were the evil supernatural parts. The movie deals a lot with mental health and how people address it. The only problem is that how people dealt with it in the movie was unbelievable. I found it hard to believe that the moment the lead character begins exhibiting strange behavior, her closest family members turn on her. Even her own psychiatrist didn't really seem willing to help. The only person truly in her corner was an ex flame who, unfortunately, ends up becoming the next mark. I just thought it was weird that no one else came to look for Rose in the end when she went to a place that was so intimate for her, to confront what was happening.It's supposed to be a thriller so I guess a lot of the scenes had to look dark and gloomy with little to no sound to enhance the effects of the scary parts. I kept thinking that no one sits alone in the dark as much as the main character in this movie. But, I guess it had to be that way to make the movie a little scary. I recommend it if you want to see something at home that was recently in theaters and doesn't take three hours to tell the story.",believable part movie evil supernatural part movie deal lot mental health people address problem people dealt movie unbelievable found hard believe moment lead character begin exhibiting strange behavior closest family member turn even psychiatrist really seem willing help person truly corner ex flame unfortunately end becoming next mark thought weird one else came look rose end went place intimate confront happening supposed thriller guess lot scene look dark gloomy little sound enhance effect scary part kept thinking one sits alone dark much main character movie guess way make movie little scary recommend want see something home recently theater take three hour tell story
"It was okay but a bit too long and slow and not enough scares. It also lost a few points for using the old 'animal in horror/thrillers' trope. That's so typical, to write an animal in the story, a pet, just for the animal to be 'killed' to add to the 'horror'. Well it didn't add to it at all. Just lazy and predictable. The film then lost a couple of more points when I realised it was just copying the premise behind It Follows, which copied the the premise behind Ring: That whole idea that to 'escape' the 'curse' you have to 'pass it on' blah blah blah....that way ensuring more sequels, no doubt.Would I go and see a sequel if they do one, which no doubt they will? Erm, nope. Still the main actress was good and it was nice to see Kyle Gallner in a horror flick again (his appearance in Scream 2022 was way to short, like nearly non-existant). I didn't go with any expectations, hence my generous 4/10 (considering the points I took off for the pets in horror flicks trope and the unoriginal plot)..",okay bit long slow enough scare also lost point using old animal horror thriller trope typical write animal story pet animal killed add horror well add lazy predictable film lost couple point realised copying premise behind follows copied premise behind ring whole idea escape curse pas blah blah blah way ensuring sequel doubt would go see sequel one doubt erm nope still main actress good nice see kyle gallner horror flick appearance scream way short like nearly non existant go expectation hence generous considering point took pet horror flick trope unoriginal plot
"The hype train really got behind this one so we went to the cinema to watch it, it wasn't a bad movie, but it certainly wasn't great either, a real shame as I thought it had potential to be a truly, terrifying film. I really hoped to be psychologically messed with and genuinely scared by this movie but when the cheap jump scares started and continued I realised this wasn't a movie that would deliver. I thought the horror genre was done with the jump scare tactic by now. It's old and been done to death already. The plot was ok, but the ending was weak, and didn't make much sense, I was bored after an hour and started thinking about what time the film was going to end, never a good sign.",hype train really got behind one went cinema watch bad movie certainly great either real shame thought potential truly terrifying film really hoped psychologically messed genuinely scared movie cheap jump scare started continued realised movie would deliver thought horror genre done jump scare tactic old done death already plot ok ending weak make much sense bored hour started thinking time film going end never good sign

Well it is a well made film with good production value. It has good cinematography, good bgm, good technical sides and most importantly a good idea. But that's it. They only thought about the idea but they could not able to put it together through a story line. The screenplay is very weak. Especially they could not build the suspense.

"I went in expecting to jump at everything but I didn't. It was a fantastic film with scenes that make you unsure of what you've just witnessed and what's really going on. It kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting for the next scare.The film is put together amazingly. Sosie puts on an award winning performance that I couldn't help but marvel at. At times, I felt just as confused and terrified at the things her character was experiencing.All that said, I must admit that I wasn't as jumpy as I thought I would be. I did, however, leave the movie a bit paranoid. The whole cursed traumatic idea is something that never crossed my mind until it was brought up in the movie, which surprised me because most movies are quite predictable.

"As much as I do not like horror, as stated in the title, I went to see this anyways. Take this review with a pinch of salt, as I spent half (maybe more) the time not watching it. The acting was very good in my opinion and did not help how scary I found the movie, as it made it more believable. Normally I am quite good at seeing what's coming, and yes you know how it's going to end in the first 5 minutes, but throughout I was given hope that would end nicely. There were a few plot points that didn't make much sense, but in terms of classic - I'm gonna scare the hell out of you - for me, it did the job. I gave it a 4 merely because it was quite good but I didn't enjoy it.

"The first time I heard about this movie was via YouTube, in a video about the next upcoming horror movies. And I can tell you, the trailer looked creepy, unsettling and interesting. The fact that people even wrote reviews on Instagram after finally watching it and defending it like the best and creepiest horror movie made me very curious.With an optimistic attitude, I jumped into the movie... and let's say that the only optimistic thing was my bag of candies.The movie starts nicely but goes really fast very boring and predictable. Cheap jumpscares and a stupid plot are at the order here. Nonetheless, I think this movie had a great idea. The smile! This could have been all around crazy people ( and not about some entity that is not explained in any way or form) that kill with a huge grin upon their faces, stay silently and this, ladies and gentlemen would have been more unsettling and make people much more nervous. A good exemple, when I watched Terrifier 1 or 2 ( I would recommend both if you are into horror/ slasher) the clown; which is already terrifying in his own way; doesn't let out a single sound, even laughs silently and by doing his mimics he's more likely to make me feel nervous then what I witnessed in this 2 hour movie.With that said, go watch it, make your own opinion but keep in mind that you'll probably laugh at some scenes because of the ridicule plot and acting. And that the ending is VERY MUCH predictable.Overall, I don't think it's worth spending almost 2 hours of your life. Go walk in the park, play some games or go drink a beer with friends, would be a much better and entertaining way to spend that time.",first time heard movie via youtube video next upcoming horror movie tell trailer looked creepy unsettling interesting fact people even wrote review instagram finally watching defending like best creepiest horror movie made curious optimistic attitude jumped movie let say optimistic thing bag candy movie start nicely go really fast boring predictable cheap jumpscares stupid plot order nonetheless think movie great idea smile could around crazy people entity explained way form kill huge grin upon face stay silently lady gentleman would unsettling make people much nervous good exemple watched terrifier would recommend horror slasher clown already terrifying way let single sound even laugh silently mimic likely make feel nervous witnessed hour movie said go watch make opinion keep mind probably laugh scene ridicule plot acting ending much predictable overall think worth spending almost hour life go walk park play game go drink beer friend would much better entertaining way spend time
"My rating of seven is only for the first 75% of the movie. The remainder deserves a two.The movie scared the crap out of me. It made me jump out of my seat. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie that's done that I even had to cover my ears during some moments. It had great ""gotha"" moments. I thought as a psychologist she would have behaved a bit different. Did she really think people would believe her and bugged me when she just didn't confess at all to Joel. I mean he knows pretty much everything else. Trying not to spoil. This movie could've been so much better if it wasn't for the last part. Where the heck did that come from? It didn't relate at all to the prior one and a half hours, and took a completely different atmosphere in the movie. Too bad. I wouldn't be surprised if we get Smile 2 but with such a disappointing ending, I'm not sure I'd watch it.",rating seven first movie remainder deserves two movie scared crap made jump seat remember last time watched movie done even cover ear moment great gotha moment thought psychologist would behaved bit different really think people would believe bugged confess joel mean know pretty much everything else trying spoil movie could much better last part heck come relate prior one half hour took completely different atmosphere movie bad surprised get smile disappointing ending sure watch
"So what do we have here? Evil that is transmitted in a chain from person to person and the main heroine who is pushed by time. Yes, all this has already happened in various variations and maybe that is why the creators do not even try to explain the story and the essence of the evil being in any way. Although there is a hint of the possibility that it could just be a mental illness and trauma from childhood (another non-original idea), the authors remain only with clich√©-like outpourings of the actors accusing each other with tears. In any case, the gradual madness of the main character is the best part of the film together with some bizarre scenes.",evil transmitted chain person person main heroine pushed time yes already happened various variation maybe creator even try explain story essence evil way although hint possibility could mental illness trauma childhood another non original idea author remain clich like outpouring actor accusing tear case gradual madness main character best part film together bizarre scene
"Smile takes elements of The Ring, It Follows, and many films from the current ""elevated horror"" trend of trauma horror and blends them into a package that is well-made and well-intentioned by its filmmakers, but doesn't completely satisfy. A few of the jump scares work like gangbusters and some fall flat and remind you of a reheated ghost movie trope from 2003, but the performances are mostly very strong and there's at least a strong mood of dread throughout. As many horror films do, it falls apart by the last 20 minutes and overexplains, brings the monster into the light a little too much, and doesn't know exactly how to draw things to a close in a satisfying way.",smile take element ring follows many film current elevated horror trend trauma horror blend package well made well intentioned filmmaker completely satisfy jump scare work like gangbusters fall flat remind reheated ghost movie trope performance mostly strong least strong mood dread throughout many horror film fall apart last minute overexplains brings monster light little much know exactly draw thing close satisfying way

"Sosie Bacon portraits a therapist whose patient claims to be seeing things no one else, like an evil presence taking control of her mind, later she commits suicide in front of her.After that, she starts seeing the things her patient was claiming to see and thinks its a curse, the rest of the movie os her trying to get rid of it and trying to overcome childhood trauma.Its well executed but I think the ending went in the wrong direction, its is pretty disturbing and it gives you goosebumps.At some point you also start questioning the sanity of her or you start thinking she might just be going crazy.One thing I have With this movie is that there is an exaggerated amount of jumpscares in this movie and at some point it starts getting boring and also as I said before, the ending goes in the wrong way. But still, I do highly recommend it and it is definitely worth the time.I give it a solid 8 out of 10, it need a some fixing but it is quite good.",sosie bacon portrait therapist whose patient claim seeing thing one else like evil presence taking control mind later commits suicide front start seeing thing patient claiming see think curse rest movie o trying get rid trying overcome childhood trauma well executed think ending went wrong direction pretty disturbing give goosebump point also start questioning sanity start thinking might going crazy one thing movie exaggerated amount jumpscares movie point start getting boring also said ending go wrong way still highly recommend definitely worth time give solid need fixing quite good

Cool premise, some good scares, the first death gave me chills - overall a worthwhile watch. Solid effects and production design as well. And, there's some nice commentary on mental health. Always appreciated.On a purely technical level there's not much to fault here. Except:The bad:
Some serious editing issues here, certain shots/scenes go on for way too long. This should have been 1h30m.I do have some complaints about the character work. I need to root for some characters, but it gets a bit difficult here. They are just so unsympathetic, which is often a problem with these newer flicks. Plus, the acting is often subpar, but I fear that may be because the script sometimes makes them do and say some very illogical things.

"A horrible nockoff of ""It Follows"" with a PTSDemon instead of an STDemon. I heard a lot of people talk about this movie. I heard people walked out of cinemas due to the movie being too scary. I honestly didn't believe this in the first place since similair allegations were made about Hereditary and Midsommar, which i found to be mediocre. (I do not dislike Midsommar. But its not a ""walk out of the cinema"" or 'too scary to wath"" film)
But since i heard quite a few friends talk about smile i thought i'd give it a try.Smile is a boring and strange movie with one of the most boring cinematography i've seen in a while. This movie has ""monotonous"" written all over it. The acting was nothing special either. Sosie Bacon as Rose is not interesting at all. I did not care about her as a person throughout the entire movie.When a movie fully relies on Jumpscare moments, which this movie only has a few of, i can't do much else but dislike it. There is absolutely nothing special, scary or horrifying about this movie. The gore feels cheap and unrealistic. Time progression is a mess. And what is it with the random upside down shots? It almost feels like a ""try hard"" to get an eerie atmosphere. Its extremely unnecessary and adds nothing to the story or movie itself.Sad to see most of my friends have horrible horror movie taste.",horrible nockoff follows ptsdemon instead stdemon heard lot people talk movie heard people walked cinema due movie scary honestly believe first place since similair allegation made hereditary midsommar found mediocre dislike midsommar walk cinema scary wath film since heard quite friend talk smile thought give try smile boring strange movie one boring cinematography seen movie monotonous written acting nothing special either sosie bacon rose interesting care person throughout entire movie movie fully relies jumpscare moment movie much else dislike absolutely nothing special scary horrifying movie gore feel cheap unrealistic time progression mess random upside shot almost feel like try hard get eerie atmosphere extremely unnecessary add nothing story movie sad see friend horrible horror movie taste
"This movie is neither intelligent nor scary. The portrayal of mental health hospitals and psychiatry in general was also devoid of reality and rudimentary understanding.I do however appreciate the underlying themes:
1) Trauma is passed from person to person.2) Those who carry trauma are often poorly understood by others, and sometimes even intentionally pushed away because others can't handle it.I have to type more. Okay. The lead I thought did a good job, as did most of the other actors. Effects were good, just not scary because the movie wasn't scary.

Don't know if that means that the storyline was super bad or that I'm just super obsessed with weight. Either way I couldn't concentrate at all and just got angry. The movie wasn't captivating so no. Wouldn't recommend it. Although think it contained some jump scares but not sure. My friends, who finished the movie said it was OK.

"I'm not going to lie when the trailer came out for this film I wasn't expecting a lot, especially being a massive horror fan but I'm not going to lie it's a solid horror film.The acting was great. Story line was good and it was freaky, jumpy in places and a great horror.Don't get me wrong it's not going to live up to other horrors but it was a great film.The director Parker Finn done a great job with this. Very gripping, freaky and jumpy in places, there was also a slight bit of comedy in places!Rose cotter played her character extremely well. She is someone that has a difficult
background dealing with her mental health from her past and still trying helping others. I love Jessie T. Usher in shaft and even though I wasn't in it a lot I still loved him. The only problem I found with the casting was Kal penn. The only reason behind that was all I could think of was Harold and kumar!!People may think 2 hours on a horror can get boring but it had me hooked after about 10/15 mins.It's bloody and gory in places and scary to the point where a bloke about 8 seats down threw his popcorn. Also how some of the people that killed themselves is brutal. I can say that last real horror film I jumped at and really enjoyed was the conjuring. It's definitely worth and watch and enjoyable if you like this sort of film.They have also left it for a possible 2nd film.",going lie trailer came film expecting lot especially massive horror fan going lie solid horror film acting great story line good freaky jumpy place great horror get wrong going live horror great film director parker finn done great job gripping freaky jumpy place also slight bit comedy place rose cotter played character extremely well someone difficult background dealing mental health past still trying helping others love jessie usher shaft even though lot still loved problem found casting kal penn reason behind could think harold kumar people may think hour horror get boring hooked min bloody gory place scary point bloke seat threw popcorn also people killed brutal say last real horror film jumped really enjoyed conjuring definitely worth watch enjoyable like sort film also left possible nd film
"What is wrong with Hollywood. So many movies have been made that by now we should be able to take away what worked well and what didn't work at all and apply it to future films. The people that did this movie, apparently didn't learn anything at all.Successful movies tell a story. You can't just have jump scares without a story (and even the jump scares are not that great). This movie has no story, no explanation (or very weak one), and worst of all - no resolution (or again, a very weak one).I am shocked at the overwhelming positive reviews. I feel they are just fake. I criticized ""The Invitation"" for lack of a good ending, but at least it told a coherent story. I get that sometimes it's creative to make you guess, or have the viewer apply their own interpretation as to what is happening. However, I personally feel that's largely just the directors/writers inability to convey the story to the screen.I think there were some scenes that should have been saved and included in a better script, but I can not in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.",wrong hollywood many movie made able take away worked well work apply future film people movie apparently learn anything successful movie tell story jump scare without story even jump scare great movie story explanation weak one worst resolution weak one shocked overwhelming positive review feel fake criticized invitation lack good ending least told coherent story get sometimes creative make guess viewer apply interpretation happening however personally feel largely director writer inability convey story screen think scene saved included better script good conscience recommend movie anyone

It lacks any substance, and is essentially a way worse version of ""It Follows"". That being said, I feel bad even comparing this film to It Follows.Do yourself a favour and skip this one.

"I could write a really long review but I think some of you already have covered the necessary stuff. I love the atmosphere, the cast and the thought behind the movie.

But there's no teens!With the score of 6.8/10 (atm) I wanted to believe that this horror movie was something out of the ordinary. But movies with a 5/10 rating is better.

It's annoying to once again have friends and family that don't believe her and also have the main character not be honest to others just for the drama.I would like to see creepy CGI on the monster when it shows up and a more paranoid feeling instead of cheesy jumpscares with LOUD NOISES.Kinda meh experience.

"...until the last two minutes.Full disclosure, the review doesn't contain literal plot spoilers but I will break down the film's message and themes in a way it could spoil the plot if you are able to make the connections. So, be warned.The film feels like it's going somewhere good. It's very blunt and on the nose with its message about the cycle of mental illness, trauma and the way society ostracises people for their mental illnesses. It hits everything right for the entirety of its runtime - alongside getting some very good horrific imagery in there - but completely falls flat at the very end. Not even the last 30 minutes or even 10 minutes. Around 2-3 minutes ruined the whole film.The conclusion of the film turns the message around. Whereas we feel like we're going to get a positive message about moving on from trauma or coming to terms with and learning to live with it, instead the film becomes about how people with trauma are a burden upon others and can only kill themselves (and pass their trauma onto other people) or continue to live while passing their trauma onto other people. There is no way a traumatised or mentally ill person can become healthy and everyone in their life is justified in cutting out the mentally ill person as the only thing that person can bring to them is pain.I left the cinema angry, to say the least. It was shallow and vile. And it only feels like the film did this for a cheap scare. One that was good on paper, but it comes at the expense of everything interesting in this film. I think that's worse than the film just being bad or mediocre as well. It had this amazing potential. It just had to cut 2 minutes at the end. No other editing changes or reshoots. It could have been good.A lot of people make a connection between this film and IT Follows. While I see it, I think the connection is shallow and skin-deep. Instead, I'd say this film is a lot more like Invisible Man (2020). It presents a dangerous force that the main character (who is a woman) believes is haunting and violating her all the while the people around her think she's ""crazy"". However, Invisible Man was made with a thematic punchline in mind. It knew it wanted to end on a note that presented a positive and heartfelt message about abuse and female liberation. Smile, on the other hand, felt like either its writer/director didn't care about its message and wanted to just scare people for the sake of it or clueless studio execs got their grubby hands all over the final edit.Should you go watch this film? No. If you do prepare to be disappointed. I gave it a 5/10 in spite of everything because it's very well made regardless. It has good camerawork, cinematography, sound design, acting etc.. The whole rest of the film is a good, slow-burn psychological horror that feels like it's building to an interesting message about mental health and trauma similar to The Babadook or Invisible Man, albeit without anywhere near the subtlety of those films. One standout scene comes near the end of the film involving a knife. It has a surreal mix of horror and comedy through the expressions of its actors and the use of its special effects. I wish more scenes like that were present in the film.P. S. I feel like I need to make a little post-script here just in case anyone feels the need to condescend me. I've discussed this with people who think they're making a good point by informing me about horror tropes and how horror films aren't supposed to make you feel good, and therefore my concerns aren't valid. While technically correct on both counts, that's irrelevant. Tropes and feeling comfortable aren't relevant to the point the film has a harmful message. Eraserhead is my favourite horror film. Every time I watch it, it makes me feel completely hopeless for a long while after. I relish it because the film - while having a pessimistic message - is spot on about the harm post-industrial capitalism inflicts upon the working class. It's correct about the despair being a working-class parent can bring in the (then) modern day. It's a film that has a strong emotional effect on me that no part of Smile ever comes close to. And, outside of horror, most of my other favourite movies of all time are ones that make me feel that kind of despair and hopelessness as I think films should have a strong emotional impact on you. I only object to Smile's message being harmful and vile and, in fact, I think the film could have a positive message while eliciting a more uncomfortable reaction from its viewers.

"I really liked a lot of this movie. I found the premise interesting and hoped like hell they weren't going to try for tracing origin and all of that. But they did.Still not too bad but you quickly figure out they're going to make out the psychologist is not smart enough to understand what she has to do and it quickly becomes a less interesting version of Fallen.But, unlike Fallen, the last fifteen minutes or so are really really stupid. We see the monster and it is sooo who cares. Really? That is what scared me for the first half of the movie. Boring. It's like yet another stretchy Gumby monster. I'm so sick of them now. This monster was done well in IT Follows and parts of IT but because it is well done in other movies, it's totally boring in this one. The smile was way way scarier. Way scarier.

"I went into Smile expecting it to be an average horror movie, and not too scary. However, I was pleasantly surprised!

I think it's a pretty unique movie, and it's definitely a fun scare!

"If you like horror movies, like myself, you've basically seen this before. You will be able to guess both particular events and the structure of the narrative including its end. And as such, it is a disappointment. I was hopping for some originality, but unfortunately everything unfolded as predicted. It is, however, well executed technically, and displays great craftsmanship. The acting is mainly good, but falls short in some instances, and that is not only due to the scripting of rather flat characters.

"Go and watch this on the big screen. Creepy and scary from start to finish. The story was decent, the characters and actors were good for the most part too. The whole theatre was jumping with gasps of fear throughout. It was a great thrill.The movie doesn't hold back and jumps right into it with frights and scares. So many funny little twists as well that keep you trying to guess what is actually going down. The lead actress is top notch and very believable, her character has a decent back story that you connect to quite quickly.

"Right off the bat something didn't make sense. They restrained the girl coming out of the ambulance, but let her free in the consultation (?) room. The reason to restrain someone is that if they are a danger to themselves or others. So they just let her free in a room full of things she can hurt herself with? This whole movie wouldn't happen if she was restrained.The way they talked about mental illnesses made me cringe. It was obvious they didn't do any research at all.I appreciated some of the camera work, shots of cars driving down the road, and upside down shots, but at times it seemed unnecessary, and doesn't add any substances to the whole movie. I get the feeling that maybe the director was a fan of shining?The story was unoriginal, the smiles were creepy but it's pretty similar to another movie I've seen before.They never explain the backstory of the monster? Demon?The ending was predictable. There were a only two ways to go. If she successfully kills herself without witnesses then it would've been a weak ending.The only thing I liked was the little twist at the end.

"Long story short, the movie is unpredictable. All nonsense we see in modern movies gone. There is no hero, nor is there anyone to save each other. "" I would recommend it for 14+. The movie ending wasn't satisfying, to be honest. But would completely recommend it for sixteen years old like me! It has chilling moments but is mostly a collection of borrowed ideas and loud jump scares. Expect extreme amounts of gore and violence, with face-slicing, face-ripping, gurgling blood, blood stains, blood spurts, a dead cat wrapped inside a child's birthday present, stabbings, gory crime scene photos, someone crashing through a glass coffee table, a scary monster, a neck bending in an unnatural way, fire, screaming, panic, nightmares, and more. Basically, The main character is a psychiatrist who loves helping others but hasn't dealt with her own issues. She descends into an unstable state and acts erratically as she struggles with hallucinations and nightmares. I am not gonna tell the whole movie as of course it's spoiling!

"The movie had a fairly good use of jump scares....but that's about it. It lacked a LOT of substance. Honestly, other than the jump scares I almost fell asleep. If you've seen ""Fallen"" with Denzel Washington and John Goodman, then you've seen a much better version of this movie.*Spoilers Below*There were so many directions this movie could have gone to make it a better movie. A connection between the mom's suicide and her curse, an explanation as to why the smile jumps from person to person, any thought to the actual plot, rather than a bunch of jump scares thrown in with some loose thread to bind it together.Some of the ""is it a dream/is it reality"" scenes were well executed, but again, without actual substance behind it, it fell rather flat.I also spent part of the movie wondering if the fiance was Pharell Williams of ""Happy"" fame, just because that at least would've been an interesting pun/riff on the theme of the movie.",movie fairly good use jump scare lacked lot substance honestly jump scare almost fell asleep seen fallen denzel washington john goodman seen much better version movie spoiler many direction movie could gone make better movie connection mom suicide curse explanation smile jump person person thought actual plot rather bunch jump scare thrown loose thread bind together dream reality scene well executed without actual substance behind fell rather flat also spent part movie wondering fiance pharell williams happy fame least would interesting pun riff theme movie
"First of all, you really shouldn't watch the trailers or teasers. I didn't and I'm so happy I did because I feel like so many plotpoints and jumpscares get ruined. To some these are perhaps predictable, but I would have been much more comfortable and less easily scared if I had watched the trailers.This covered, I really enjoyed this movie. I hadn't seen a truly scary movie in some time and I remember years ago I loved seeing movies like The Conjuring nad Insidious. But after watching those and the sequels that followed them my intrest in these types of movies started to decline because of repetitiveness. The movie being set around mental illness and trauma is also something that made it seem not entirely fictional.I especially liked the sound effects and eerie feeling I got from these aforementioned movies and Smile brought this back and more. I watched it in theatre with some sort of 'ultra sound' extra effects added to the audio which allowed for an intense, loud and personal movie experience. This I must say really just played off so well with the movie. Squinting your eyes because the music just makes it seem like something will happen at any moment. A scene change that switches to someone opening a can of catfood that was so loud and perfectly time right after a silence gave everyone in the theater a good scare which was followed by a laugh because of how stupid it was that this innocent scene made them (and me) jump.It is a real good watch and I recommend wholeheartedly that you go see it in theatres or at least somewhere where the audio can actually do its job and make this movie something that I hope will stay as a standalone movie because a sequel would honestly never live up to the expectation.",first really watch trailer teaser happy feel like many plotpoints jumpscares get ruined perhaps predictable would much comfortable le easily scared watched trailer covered really enjoyed movie seen truly scary movie time remember year ago loved seeing movie like conjuring nad insidious watching sequel followed intrest type movie started decline repetitiveness movie set around mental illness trauma also something made seem entirely fictional especially liked sound effect eerie feeling got aforementioned movie smile brought back watched theatre sort ultra sound extra effect added audio allowed intense loud personal movie experience must say really played well movie squinting eye music make seem like something happen moment scene change switch someone opening catfood loud perfectly time right silence gave everyone theater good scare followed laugh stupid innocent scene made jump real good watch recommend wholeheartedly go see theatre least somewhere audio actually job make movie something hope stay standalone movie sequel would honestly never live expectation

This one had me jumping more than any other scary movie has and I'm only a moderately jumpy person. As much as I hated to admit it in the moment, twice I had major chills that hit me out of nowhere and lasted for minutes. Terrifying, a bit gory, keeps you on your toes the whole time. It really messes with your head and the development is good enough that it keeps you sucked into the story. Great length and the ending absolutely slayed me.

I think with better actors and a different ending would have made this more entertaining.I loved the lead guy, though the story between them was a random plot to throw in.

But since those are design choices. The movie is great and a must see for horror fans.The movie shows the effects of Mental illness and how other people react to it. Obviously it's hard to prove you aren't crazy when the things you say sound crazy, but I respect the realistic portrayl of people, and the acting is on point.My closest comparison for this Movie is a much higher production quality version of It Follows, fans will see it very quickly, enjoy the movie.",like said better preview would lead believe current top contender horror film year jump scare likeactually time real tense twist good although done yes plot time becomes obvious well scored even body horror illicits scare movie good regardless kind horror want see biggest complaint shot turn camera upside reason jarring also extremely loud distractingly time one bright flashing logo bothersome since design choice movie great must see horror fan movie show effect mental illness people react obviously hard prove crazy thing say sound crazy respect realistic portrayl people acting point closest comparison movie much higher production quality version follows fan see quickly enjoy movie
"People need to quit hating on jump scares, not every horror movie has to be The Shining.This movie is such a fantastic blend of jump scares, gory and squirmy moments, and truly well-made psychological horror. There were multiple scenes that will stick with me as nightmare fuel, and unlike a lot of horror offerings these days, they really followed through in the final act and delivered a horrifying and satisfying climax to an already above-average scary movie. This is instantly one of my favorite horror films and now I can't wait to see what's next from Parker Finn.In addition to the scares being done right, this movie also looks and feels eery throughout. The cinematography is perfect - the long, winding upside down shots remind me of Stanley Kubrick or Denis Villeneuve - and the score and sound effects are perfect. The progression of the plot can sometimes feel familiar, but the suspense and the feeling of unease is crafted so well that it doesn't really matter. Even though we know things are probably going to play out like a horror movie plays out, the scares are so good and so frequent that it never really diminishes how freaked out you are.So don't listen to any of the bad reviews of this film talking about jump scares and what not. If you enjoy movies that are genuinely scary and well-made, give it a shot. It will not disappoint.A warning if you've lived through any kind of severe trauma, this one might be a very tough watch. The premise centers on how we experience trauma, and it is very bleak at times. In addition to being scary, the movie is also great at being utterly disturbing.Oh and also Kal Penn has a small role and it's always great to see him!",people need quit hating jump scare every horror movie shining movie fantastic blend jump scare gory squirmy moment truly well made psychological horror multiple scene stick nightmare fuel unlike lot horror offering day really followed final act delivered horrifying satisfying climax already average scary movie instantly one favorite horror film wait see next parker finn addition scare done right movie also look feel eery throughout cinematography perfect long winding upside shot remind stanley kubrick denis villeneuve score sound effect perfect progression plot sometimes feel familiar suspense feeling unease crafted well really matter even though know thing probably going play like horror movie play scare good frequent never really diminishes freaked listen bad review film talking jump scare enjoy movie genuinely scary well made give shot disappoint warning lived kind severe trauma one might tough watch premise center experience trauma bleak time addition scary movie also great utterly disturbing oh also kal penn small role always great see
"I know I'm super young, but honestly im not even upset with the movie. I know that a lot of people don't like the ending, which is understandable. But I mean... honestly this was the scariest movie I've ever seen. I mean there was lots of jumpscares that sent me flying back into my seat, lot's of plot twists, and even when you know what's going to happen it scares you anyways. And this movie also has some very goary scenes, if you like that. If you are reading this, PLEASE watch this movie. (at your own risk.) You won't regret it. I mean, I am totally impressed with this. And the trailor does it no justice. When I watched the trailler, I was thinking 'wow this movie looks really corny and stupid', but I was FOR SURE wrong about it. And if you have high standards, unlike me, please just watch it anyways! You might not regret it.",know super young honestly im even upset movie know lot people like ending understandable mean honestly scariest movie ever seen mean lot jumpscares sent flying back seat lot plot twist even know going happen scare anyways movie also goary scene like reading please watch movie risk regret mean totally impressed trailor justice watched trailler thinking wow movie look really corny stupid sure wrong high standard unlike please watch anyways might regret
I'm a teenage girl so take that to heart or just keep it in mind. I love all horror films and am an absolute junky when it comes to finding good movies. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Me and a friend saw it together and I can still remember not knowing what was going to happen in certain parts of the movie. I love when a film makes me think a little bit about the plot and the storyline around it. I found myself questioning certain scenes in the movie that lead up to the part I was watching at that given moment. The story of this movie connects so well together and I loved all of the plot twists. Watch it right now.,teenage girl take heart keep mind love horror film absolute junky come finding good movie one best movie ever seen friend saw together still remember knowing going happen certain part movie love film make think little bit plot storyline around found questioning certain scene movie lead part watching given moment story movie connects well together loved plot twist watch right

"Bland, boring and overwhelmingly predictable, Smile tries it's best to sit within the same sphere as seat-grabbers like Don't Breathe, It Follows and The Babadook. However, where it's ""inspirations"" have teeth, Smile kind of gums you to death instead of tearing in. Jumpscares galore and not a one of them entertaining with character interactions and writing that seem slapped together in a board room. If you've seen Sinister, Insidious, Saint Maud or the like you can predict Smile's big kicker long before it plays it's hand. But if you're looking for a movie to eat dinner alongside, it'll do. It'll get a jump out of you on first viewing, but the film is as full of holes as it's monster.",bland boring overwhelmingly predictable smile try best sit within sphere seat grabber like breathe follows babadook however inspiration teeth smile kind gum death instead tearing jumpscares galore one entertaining character interaction writing seem slapped together board room seen sinister insidious saint maud like predict smile big kicker long play hand looking movie eat dinner alongside get jump first viewing film full hole monster
"It's lame, what can I say?More of a whole eye-roll throughout. From gagging at the mockery of those with REAL trauma to the unoriginal camera twists and turns. Nothing scary about that.Acting was mediocre l, the plot was like some one far fetching. Wasn't much of a horror, or thriller. It's like, someone mixed IT and the movie Devil. Which those are worthy and original. But I guess if you were bored, like I was, it's worth a view. But if you're a horror fan like I am, I would say find something else. But if you're just curious, go for it.I could get more of a jump-scare watch R. L. Stine.",lame say whole eye roll throughout gagging mockery real trauma unoriginal camera twist turn nothing scary acting mediocre l plot like one far fetching much horror thriller like someone mixed movie devil worthy original guess bored like worth view horror fan like would say find something else curious go could get jump scare watch r l stine
"Scary, if a tad predictable. Smile was advertised brilliantly by planting smiling characters from the movie into everyday situations such as sports crowds. Such impact. The movie however, suffers from the problem a lot of great jump-scare films suffer from, in that the premise is better than the outcome. You will jump at a couple of spots, and the cinematography is a gem with a great mix of colours, and soundtrack to boot.In essence though, despite the imaginative idea, this falls into a similar vein as The Purge - good idea, frightening imagination on the part of the writer, but ends up being too predictable unfortunately.",scary tad predictable smile advertised brilliantly planting smiling character movie everyday situation sport crowd impact movie however suffers problem lot great jump scare film suffer premise better outcome jump couple spot cinematography gem great mix colour soundtrack boot essence though despite imaginative idea fall similar vein purge good idea frightening imagination part writer end predictable unfortunately
